"description":"Gardening has shown to improve our mood, save us money, and strengthen our connection with food. However, a large chunk of potential gardeners live in apartments and are confined by a lack of natural sunlight, time to invest in learning how to garden, as well as both indoor and outdoor space to fit any plants. With the little space that people do have, many have invested money and time into setting up indoor gardens, only to have their plants die after a busy week. What this means is that for many of those who have a desire to grow fresh veggies and herbs without investing large chunks of their time and space, there are limited options available to them.\nWe’d like to introduce Furnäture.\nProblem & Motivation\nTo promote sustainable and healthy habits while educating people about nature.\nOur Solution\nCombining agriculture, technology, and design, furnäture is an automated hydroponic gardening system embedded inside of beautiful furniture like an end-table.\nFurnäture is a semi-automated urban garden integrated into furniture; hence the name combines the words furniture and nature, with its emphasis on the Danish ä pronounced \"Fur nah ture\".\nFurnäture promotes the fresh food movement by easily providing apartment access to fresh veggies in a compact, beautiful, and space-saving piece.\nOur vision is to create social impact on the “future of corporate food order.” Furnäture was conceived based on the vision of increasing local production of food and creating a social movement for alternative food sovereignty. While Furnäture operates on a smaller scale in terms of the volume of food produced, it is a first step in our vision: creating agency of what we eat and how it's grown.\nHow it Works\nAutomated aeroponics system is controlled by an intuitive app-based experience. You can control settings of the system and get notified with instructions on any maintenance for the unit including adding nutrients and other things that aren't automated.\n[[youtube/1S2CH8MYwU4]]",

"description":"This project came out of a senior thesis project for the RPI Design Innovation and Society Senior Thesis class.\nThe initial critical design prompt was to create a critical design artefact that changed people's perception of a certain issue. Higher Perspectives VR explores the intersection of virtual reality, mindfulness, and perception. The critical design addresses a “double bind”; we don’t have enough time to relax because technology is everywhere, yet a technological “fix” is presented anyways.\nInstead of fighting the technological trend, Higher Perspectives VR aims to provide the opportunity, when none other exists, to use technology to regain mental and overall health and wellbeing. Higher Perspectives VR combines the concept of mindfulness/meditation and modern-day technology trends into a product that will truly help people achieve higher perspectives.\n[[youtube/RRpUiobh6e4]]",

"description":"What is mutual aid?\n\n\"Mutual aid projects are a form of political participation in which people take responsibility for caring for one another and changing political conditions, not just through symbolic acts or putting pressure on their representatives in government, but by actually building new social relations that are more survivable.”- Dean Spade, Big Door Brigade\n\nWhy mutual aid?\nCOVID-19 has revealed the failures of the United States economic and political systems. Amid this unprecedented public health crisis, mutual aid networks are sprouting up across the world, and Long Island in an effort to help those who continue to be left behind by traditional political institutions.\n",

"description":"There is so little time, and so much to do - I must ask - are you working towards solving the right problems? Poverty, mental health, climate destruction, access to healthcare - There are thousands of problems in the world, so which ones will you dedicate your life to solving? Just because you can do something - it doesn’t mean you should. Innovation and problem solving can be spun into anything, from make a more efficient weapon to selling more candy. My advice: don’t do nonsense. In order to find the right problems, you need to learn to think and see the world differently, to understand your values, and to have the creative confidence to take action.\nThis book will force you to wear your creativity hat and take out your problem finders toolkit. We all have this ability, and it starts with empathy. You might be frustrated at the state of the world and your responsibility to bring about change. You may feel inspired at the endless opportunities to pursue and things to learn. I spent my life doing what I felt I could to help others - and book is the best shot at sharing the mindset I’ve developed to live a meaningful life - an Inventor’s mindset. This book won't teach you the detailed scientific impacts of ocean acidification or the mechanisms for engineering pollution, neither will it delve into detail of the root cause of homelessness. We hope that after finishing this book you will realize your true potential, and how you can use your skills and creativity to solve these problems. You can do it. I am faithful that you will use this book as a way to look at the world in a more creative way, in order to come up with solutions that can help affect a billion people in need. Our future depends on it. What is the value that you are creating? Listen, encourage, engage, smile and suspend disbelief, invest time and effort in others, listen encourage and engage.\n",

"summary":"We have all this data on ourselves and our health but how are we using it for ourselves? The idea behind the health tracker is to piggyback off of existing sensors and data that our phones and wearables can have as well as self-reported user data in order to come to understandings about our own health that can directly inform our daily decisions to better steer us towards personalized. Many people suffer from food and environmental allergies, but sometimes go for years without knowing what. Often elimination diets are the only thing that can inform these decisions since allergen tests are not accurate. By combining self-reported data and information passively collected from smartphones, this app vwould use pattern recognition with passive and active data in order to come to conclusions about what sort of potential environmental or food triggers are affecting a users health. The app would be able to learn over time that pain or headaches are worse depending on the weather patterns, on trips to certain restaurants, or when eating certain foods or exercising a certain amount. We think very short term in a 2-3 day window but sometimes allergens can affect us for weeks at a time and there can be a lag period before symptoms start, for example in the case of acne based off of eating foods. This makes it very difficult for us to understand what is causing these symtoms. Winner of the 1st place prize at the University Innovation Fellows Regional Meetup\n",

"description":"## **Systemic Problems With Current Media**\nAccording to PEW research center, US dialogue is more divided than ever. Media echo-chambers and a concentration of media sources are partly to blame. The consequences of political polarization have an impact on our society and communities:\nWe’re segregated in our own communities. We’re less likely to help each other out. We feel pressure to conform in our groups. (to things that might not even be true) Deception is more likely. Gridlock is damaging our government institutions.\n### **Our Group Found A Question**\nHow might we make it easier for consumers of diverse media sources to converge on the truth?\nOur brainstorming led us to an idea to pull various news sources together in one place where readers can learn about what's going on in a way that's easily accessible, includes diverse perspectives, and is not too far from where they lean on, so they don't reject these perspectives right away. All the information on the site is also fact checked, and this information will be available to the reader.\nIn order to combat these issues around media credibility and polarization, we've developed an online platform to help readers more easily and quickly converge on the truth by diversifying their news content. We help readers seek the truth by creating an aggregated news feed that brings in content from an array of news mediums, sources, and perspectives. Our hope is that readers will gain the most informed and holistic understanding of any relevant news events or topic by seeing news stories from the left and right, from CNN.com and reddit, and from different authors. We organize news stories in categories and subcategories so that you can filter through news sources based off of what current events you want to learn about.\nThe site has an algorithm that notices your tendency to read certain sources with certain politic bends, for example, it adapts to show you stories that might bring your reading back to the center.\nJoin us in seeking the truth at Veritas\n\"We are a nation of people that only watch channels that tell us we are right\"\n[[youtube/vKrdRONcKBo]]",
