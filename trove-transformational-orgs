We plant the seeds of this world through the choices we make each day. The ways we care for ourselves, respond to the needs of others, and participate in community life are opportunities to practice how we want to transform ourselves, our communities, and our collective systems. Today, we face tremendous challenges as a country — from the detention of migrant children and families, to the climate crisis, mass shootings, sexual harassment and assault.  Violence is a building block of our history, and of the power systems that shape our culture. Violence keeps us disconnected from our humanity and each other.  While many people may struggle to stay hopeful, Resonance Network participants are coming together because we also see a widespread hunger for — and possibility of — something different. By transforming the roots of violence, we can foster families, communities, and a culture that are thriving, just, and compassionate.  \\n",

They seek to nurture a caring culture, one focused on supporting each other, both as groups or as wider communities. In practice, they are reclaiming the economy, sparking entrepreneurship, reimagining work, reskilling themselves and weaving webs of connection and support.

By means of applying an inclusive and participatory approach in which the research team works in equal partnership with the associated projects, a Transformative Theory of Change – a roadmap for maximising the projects’ transformative potential – is co-constructed.

"description":"Women in Big Data (WiBD) started as a grass-roots organization in 2015 with the mission to inspire and connect women in big data careers. Starting with 15 members and one chapter in San Francisco’s Bay Area, the WiBD community grew to over 17,000 members across 37 chapters and six continents spreading inspiration, growing networks, and promoting member success on an ever-expanding platform.\\nIn 2020, the organization filed paperwork that shifted Women in Big Data from grassroots to non-profit, expanding funding capabilities and laying a foundation for a new mission. The founders realized that, as important as inspiration and connection are, their ability to move the needle on a future in which gender and resources don’t limit equitable participation is finite. A new mission was outlined to cultivate tangible opportunities; unlock latent potential, act as a catalyst for advancement, and empower equity allies of any gender.\\n",

"description":"Computer vision has become one of the largest computer science research communities. We have made tremendous progress in recent years over a wide range of areas, including object recognition, image understanding, video analysis, 3D reconstruction, etc. \\n\\nHowever, despite the expansion of our field, the percentage of female faculty members and researchers both in academia and in industry is still relatively low. As a result, many female researchers working in computer vision may feel isolated and do not have a lot of opportunities to meet with other women. \\nThe goals of this workshop are to:\\n- Raise visibility of female computer vision researchers by presenting invited research talks by women who are role models in this field.\\n- Give opportunities to junior female students or researchers to present their work via a poster session and travel awards. \\n- Share experience and career advice for female students and professionals.\\n\\n",

"description":"Queer in AI’s mission is to raise awareness of queer issues in AI/ML, foster a community of queer researchers and celebrate the work of queer scientists. We use “queer” as an umbrella term for people with diverse non-normative sexual orientations, romantic orientations, and/or genders, corresponding to acronyms like LGBTQIA2S+. We also explicitly include those questioning their identities.\\nQueer in AI was established by queer scientists in AI with the mission to make the AI community a safe and inclusive place that welcomes, supports, and values LGBTQIA2S+ people. We work towards this aim by building a visible community of queer AI scientists through conference workshops, social meetups, conference poster sessions, mentoring programs, graduate application financial aid, and many other initiatives. Another crucial part of our mission is to raise awareness of queer issues in the general AI community and to encourage and highlight research on and solutions to these problems.\\n",
