"summary":"Protect ecosystems and communities by equipping them with tools to detect and respond to ecological changes as they happen. Bioregional resilience depends on the ability to trace outbreaks, monitor deforestation, track biodiversity shifts, and understand how climate events impact land and water systems over time. Technology can make this possible through real-time ecological monitoring, dynamic mapping, and trend analysis that connects local observations with global datasets, empowering communities to act early, coordinate effectively, and safeguard both human and ecological health.",

"summary":"This list emerged in response to a culmination of requests by leaders, organizers, stewards, and advocates within and for the bioregional movement. After reviewing notes from a variety of meetings held over the past few years, the patterns coalesced enough to create this list. Specific thanks are given to organizational leaders for their openness in our conversations and deep appreciation for those who shared resources publicly for all to benefit.",

"summary":"Research and Product Development by Clare Brodeur.  Medium article.  Feb 11, 2025\n- Recommendations for “Groups Near Me”: This would support members in discovering place-based groups that are active where they live, so that they can easily join existing efforts.\n- Map layers with information on geology, topography, hydrology/watersheds, ecology and species data, soil, human populations, etc.\n- Network Map: This is a network map with nodes and connections showing the actors present in a bioregion and the relationships between them.\n- Network Recommendations: The network map could power periodic recommendations for collaboration. The goal would be to add value to existing initiatives and reduce duplication of effort.\n- Distributed election of group stewards: Stewards of groups should be affirmed by the members, denoting which other members they trust with stewardship responsibilities. Members with enough collective trust can automatically be granted those responsibilities.",
