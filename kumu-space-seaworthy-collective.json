However, we are decades away from an infrastructure that can support the needs of the US and we would still have to train the general population how to properly compost. With recycling at an all-time low, how could we possibly expect to get composting correct? That is the reason we have created what we have, a 100% biodegradable material that we manufacture into straws, cutlery, and soon to be cups that will biodegrade in natural landfill conditions.

"summary":"Co-Founder and CEO, Andrés Avello embodies the adventurous, fun-loving spirit of PADL. Born and raised in Key Biscayne, FL, Avello grew up on the ocean, and he, along with his best friends Felipe Jauregui and Khalil Khouri, created PADL to offer an easier, fun way to provide access to paddleboarding and the water as a whole. Whether he is focusing on growing the business, launching new locations, speaking with customers, fundraising or engineering, Avello is constantly brainstorming to improve the rental process for all. His favorite part about paddleboarding is that it is an activity designed for everyone. Whether you want to fish for tarpon, spot a dolphin under your feet, practice yoga or explore mangroves, you will have an unforgettable experience unlike any other. Out of all 22 stations, he would have to pick East Greynolds Park as his favorite where you get the perfect combination of paddling next to a skyline or floating down the calm Oleta River surrounded by mangroves. You will always find him in his PADL hat, but when he isn’t on the clock you will find him fishing, camping and enjoying the fresh air with his family. ",

That's why I'm determined to reshape the way we educate and empower the global community when it comes to the AI of tomorrow. \n\nMy ideas are based in radically impactful publications in next-generation AI ethics. \n\nFirstly, by adopting five core tenets of development comprising beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice, and explicability at the heart of next-generation technology, we can target an era of rapid and scalable development immune to failures ranging anywhere from minor short-sighted development practices to major dystopian sci-fi anxieties (https://doi.org/10.1162/99608f92.8cd550d1). \n\nSecondly, by embedding design thinking as a fundamental foundation for both education and productionization, we can encourage the development of emergent technologies in more creative applications while remaining cognizant of potential vulnerabilities, risk areas, and inequities inherent in adoption (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sheji.2019.11.015). \n\nFinally, codifying defined systems for auditing, evaluating, and pivoting applied systems leveraging AI is incredibly important for past, present, and future developments in the field due to the sensitivity of human-built technologies to sources of human bias (https://doi.org/10.1145/3531146.3533213).\n\nIf any of that sounds interesting to you, and/or you're curious to learn more about the future of tech from someone both ambitious and critical of the field, please don't hesitate to reach out!",
