"summary":"At StrawFish we provide 100% biodegradable single-use plastic alternatives made from sea-shells to major brands like CAVA, Royal Caribbean, MSG Sphere, and others. We are solving the plastic problem. In the sustainable disposables industry, you often hear the word compostable as the key word. However, we are decades away from an infrastructure that can support the needs of the US and we would still have to train the general population how to properly compost. With recycling at an all-time low, how could we possibly expect to get composting correct? That is the reason we have created what we have, a 100% biodegradable material that we manufacture into straws, cutlery, and soon to be cups that will biodegrade in natural landfill conditions. Consumers simply have to throw our products in the garbage and let nature take care of the rest.",

"summary":"Co-Founder and CEO, Andrés Avello embodies the adventurous, fun-loving spirit of PADL. Born and raised in Key Biscayne, FL, Avello grew up on the ocean, and he, along with his best friends Felipe Jauregui and Khalil Khouri, created PADL to offer an easier, fun way to provide access to paddleboarding and the water as a whole. Whether he is focusing on growing the business, launching new locations, speaking with customers, fundraising or engineering, Avello is constantly brainstorming to improve the rental process for all. His favorite part about paddleboarding is that it is an activity designed for everyone. Whether you want to fish for tarpon, spot a dolphin under your feet, practice yoga or explore mangroves, you will have an unforgettable experience unlike any other. Out of all 22 stations, he would have to pick East Greynolds Park as his favorite where you get the perfect combination of paddling next to a skyline or floating down the calm Oleta River surrounded by mangroves. You will always find him in his PADL hat, but when he isn’t on the clock you will find him fishing, camping and enjoying the fresh air with his family. ",

"summary":"\"Call me Kash!\"\n\nI am a passionate educator, full-stack software engineer, and data-driven technologist with a focus in AI ethics, research, and development. \n\nToday's world is defined by new technologies that evolve at a pace with which even the best of us can barely keep up. That's why I'm determined to reshape the way we educate and empower the global community when it comes to the AI of tomorrow. \n\nMy ideas are based in radically impactful publications in next-generation AI ethics. \n\nFirstly, by adopting five core tenets of development comprising beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice, and explicability at the heart of next-generation technology, we can target an era of rapid and scalable development immune to failures ranging anywhere from minor short-sighted development practices to major dystopian sci-fi anxieties (https://doi.org/10.1162/99608f92.8cd550d1). \n\nSecondly, by embedding design thinking as a fundamental foundation for both education and productionization, we can encourage the development of emergent technologies in more creative applications while remaining cognizant of potential vulnerabilities, risk areas, and inequities inherent in adoption (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sheji.2019.11.015). \n\nFinally, codifying defined systems for auditing, evaluating, and pivoting applied systems leveraging AI is incredibly important for past, present, and future developments in the field due to the sensitivity of human-built technologies to sources of human bias (https://doi.org/10.1145/3531146.3533213).\n\nIf any of that sounds interesting to you, and/or you're curious to learn more about the future of tech from someone both ambitious and critical of the field, please don't hesitate to reach out!",

"summary":"Aarav Chavda is the Co-Founder and CEO of Inversa Leathers, a regenerative materials startup solving the biodiversity crisis with fashion. By crafting luxurious leathers from invasive species, Inversa is leading fashion to solve an ecological disaster that drives 60% of species extinctions and causes $423B of damage annually. Today, working with dozens of brands across leather categories, Inversa and its partners have saved up to 2 billion native animals.\n\nAs a recreational scuba diver, Aarav noticed the invasive lionfish’s destruction on Caribbean coral reefs and wondered how to create systems to remove invasive species and benefit the planet’s ecosystem. He also noticed a need in the fashion industry and its consumers to use materials that go beyond the traditional notion of sustainability and actively have a part in improving our natural ecosystems.\n\nPrior to co-founding Inversa, Aarav worked as a consultant with McKinsey, where he focused on growth strategy. He holds a B.S.E. from Princeton University, in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering with a focus on materials science and robotics.\n\nIn 2022, Aarav was named Forbes 30 Under 30 for his contribution to the materials space. Inversa is funded by Conservation International, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, biodiversity venture fund Superorganism, and Meliorate Partners. Inversa's solutions have been featured in the Wall Street Journal, Business of Fashion, Forbes, The Guardian, PBS, Fast Company, Vogue, and Women's Wear Daily.",

"summary":"I'm an alumnus from The University of Florida determined to use my combination of experience in mechanical, ocean, and signal processing engineering to study ocean environments. \n\nWhile growing up, I solidified a strong background in both theoretical and applied oceanography. My training included research trips, diving to collect ocean floor samples through NaGISA (Natural Geography in Shore Areas), collecting and testing water samples with handheld instruments, and teaching the community through outreach events hosted by the Navarre Beach Marine Science Station. \n\nTaking this knowledge, I went to the University of Florida to complete my mechanical engineering degree. I took the required course work and proved my success by passing the Mechanical Fundamentals of Engineering exam and becoming an EIT. I then entered the Ocean Engineering Masters Thesis program at Florida Atlantic University, where I completed the required coursework and am currently working as a signals processing researcher. The research consists of daily use of MATLAB, where I use innovative signal processing techniques to process data from ocean sensors such as ADCPs and magnetometers. It was also an opportunity to communicate with a panel of experts and present my results with them on a biweekly basis, bolstering my ability to present complicated information in a succinct and clear manner.\n\nCurrently, My PhD topic centers on the use of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles for target detection. My research involves sub-optimal search algorithms for real-time applications as well as blind source separation methods. Furthermore, I've joined technical groups dedicated to the development of Unmanned Surface Vehicles. My main tasks in these elective projects involved underwater acoustics and developing ROS/Python algorithms for computer vision efforts. I was also required to complete 3-D modeling designs and maintain electrical systems.\n\nI'm always looking forward to a new challenge.",

"summary":"Gaelin Rosenwaks is a marine scientist, explorer and photographer. Always fascinated by the marine world, Gaelin began diving at 14 and has since continued exploring ocean ecosystems. She began her career at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution where she researched over-wintering patterns of Southern Ocean zooplankton. Gaelin earned her Master’s Degree in Coastal Environmental Management from Duke University working with the Tag-A-Giant program and conducting research on the migratory movements of Giant Bluefin Tunas. She has conducted fieldwork throughout the world from the Antarctic to the Arctic on icebreakers to both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans on fishing vessels. To Gaelin, there is nothing better than being in the open ocean surrounded by endless blue water and passing wildlife. Alarmed by the changes happening in the oceans, Gaelin founded Global Ocean Exploration (GOE) to share her passion for ocean exploration, marine conservation and photography. GOE is a company devoted to bringing cutting-edge expedition science to the public through photography, writing, and film.

"summary":"Here is our story: \n\nWe are a mother-daughter duo who began asking ourselves, \"What would a man say?\", as we reviewed everything we wrote in a non-social context (think emails, inter-office memos, cover letters), where we felt the most held-back by our gender. While searching for answers to this question we began to notice all the over-polite, let's-not-make-anyone-feel-bad words and niceties we used -- words and phrases men would never use. Was this undermining our competency and/our leadership? Were we being perceived/understood as less capable than men? How could that be!? After all, we consider ourselves independent, strong, competent and capable. \n\nThe differences we noticed between men's writing and women's writing were mind-blowing, so we turned to data to see what the experts were saying. What we found made our jaws drop! \nThe way that men express themselves is actually far, far different from the way women express themselves. (Not good, not bad -- just different.) And, as it turns out, what men say is always more effective. The implications of implicit gender bias reach far and wide, and create inequality gaps in pay, in opportunity, in value and in representation. With knowledge, resources, support and a really good tool, we can change this. \n\nApplying the research on communication to our own writing, we created WriteByMe.\n\nWriteByMe is a tool unlike any other! It empowers your writing and removes the likelihood of implicit gender bias by identifying inefficient and ineffective words and phrases and, based on academic research, suggests replacements and rewrites. Much more than a text editor, WriteByMe educates and empowers women and people everywhere, providing information and resources that explain how replacing inefficient words can make writing more effective.",

"summary":"At Kadeya, the world's first closed loop beverage vending system, we completely rethink the bottled beverage supply chain toward a circular system that makes a positive impact for workers, consumers, and the planet with every sip, gulp and swig. \n\nKadeya currently focuses on supporting workplaces where hydration is existential – construction sites to Air Force bases, refineries to manufacturing plants – helping organizations attain and report safety and sustainability goals to attract and retain top talent without the logistical headaches of pallets of bottled water or 5-gallon jugs ($30B market in the US alone).\n\nI bring nearly 20 years of experience in pioneering climate solutions, business development, fundraising, and international expansion to leading Kadeya's growth and innovation. Our patented kiosks vend all kinds of cold non-alcoholic beverages quickly and conveniently, from flat filtered water to carbonated, caffeinated, flavored, and enhanced beverages. \n\nBest of all, we filter microplastics from our products and are on track to be the first PFAS/PFOAS-free packaged beverage in the world.\n\nAfter enjoying beverages, consumers return Kadeya’s patented bottles to our station where they are autonomously inspected, washed, sanitized, dried, and refilled in situ. Think of us as a combo dishwasher + soda fountain in a box the size of an upright piano.\n\nOur fully circular system eliminates the need for single-use beverage containers, delivering reduced costs and carbon footprint while improving upon quality and convenience. Across five commercial deployments we continue to see 99% return rates with no penalty or deposit.\n\nWe have committed all units through 2025 and are building our waitlist for 2026.

"summary":"I specialize in empowering visionary leaders to navigate the complex landscape of climate capital and customers. Subscribe to my newsletter Find Funding Faster for actionable insights: https://findfundingfaster.substack.com/\n\nI HELP FOUNDERS RAISE MONEY\n\nAs an angel investor myself, I understand how to craft a pitch that converts and pick the right funding streams at the right time. \n\nTHE BACK STORY\n\nThe seed for Impact Stars was planted in 1997 when I accidentally created a new Interactive Solutions practice within the direct marketing agency where I worked. Then, the dot com boom happened and my little practice became a 'hot' asset. As the company started courting suitors, I found myself presenting to corporate boards of billion-dollar companies. While it was a heady experience, it left me feeling strangely empty. \n\nAfter we got acquired by Young & Rubicam, I got a call from the the Phillip Morris account lead. She asked me to help come up with a digital strategy to prevent smoking in youth. We presented to the Phillip Morris team. It went well. As I walked back to our offices on 285 Madison Avenue, it hit me: I'm helping a cigarette company launch an anti-smoking campaign. Ironic. I found myself wondering, \"Is this what I want my legacy to be?\" \n\nI moved on from Y&R to IBM. While at IBM, I started helping women in Afghanistan running underground schools under the Taliban. That led to many more adventures - traveling to remote villages in India, writing a book (with a Foreword by the Dalai Lama!) and training hundreds of youth in foster care. \n\nIF YOU HAVE A BIG VISION... LET'S BRING IT TO LIFE. Get in touch and tell me what's on your mind.",

"summary":"In 2022, I made a major career pivot. I had pursued the medical field for many years because I deeply hoped to devote my life to positively impacting people's health. As I finished my master's degree with a focus on water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), I realized that the vast idea of \"water\" attracted me for its all encompassing nature--it significantly impacts not only human health but also our businesses, climate, and every day activities. I decided to focus my work on supporting efforts to improve the quality, access, and efficiency of water. \n\nIn 2021, I was part of a team at One Shared World that developed a mock UN resolution urging world leaders to prioritize universal WASH access to all citizens. After discussions with UN leaders, part of our mock resolution was adopted into a legitimate resolution that was unanimously passed in December 2021.\n\nIn spring 2022, I completed my masters degree with a focus on WASH and its relationship with human health in the Peruvian Amazon. \n\nIn 2022, I teamed up with Stuart Rudick, a water investor and advocate, to develop the HydroDAO community which supports innovators in the water industry through networking events, weekly newsletters, and online discussion platforms.\n\nIn the future, we are developing a fund that can invest in companies that are creating the most groundbreaking solutions to massive water challenges. We remain optimistic that novel systems and technologies can help generate clean and accessible water to everyone on the planet!",

"summary":"Robert is our founder and CEO. As Global SubDive’s exploration leader and lead submersible pilot, he oversees submersible project development and planning.\n\nThis company represents his life’s adventure, which has been stimulated by a constant passion for underwater exploration and a knack for improving the functionality of mechanical devices. He learned how to build a recreational hookah system in 1980 as the first full-time employee of Brownie’s THIRD LUNG™, a job that inaugurated his love for diving. In the late 1980’s Robert began experimenting with technical mixed gas diving and was the enterprising force behind the development of what would become the Halcyon “PVR-BASC” rebreather. This rebreather helped revolutionize deep, technical diving and would lead to numerous world record cave dives. Over more than 15 yrs these and many other innovations were developed with Robert’s business partner and friend, Jarrod Jablonski, with whom he founded Halcyon Manufacturing in 1995.\n\nRobert continues to bring innovative solutions into a wide range of marine applications, building a team at LW Americas, which supports mixed gas supply and submersible support systems for yachts and expedition ships around the world.\n\nGlobal SubDive currently supplies submersible and DP1 Ship Services (M/V GO America) to NAVSEA SFOMF near Port Everglades, FL.",

An undocumented immigrant for over two decades, I understand first-hand the complicated ways that inadequate housing, limited transportation options, and environmental risks create structural barriers to upward mobility.\n\nThe first in my family to go to college, I’ve made it my mission to tackle these inequities head on. I attended Harvard University on a full scholarship and received a BA in Government, Economics, and Visual & Environmental Studies. Whether investing in cutting-edge tools to achieve carbon neutrality in NYC, financing the largest public transit agency in the US, delivering life-saving medicines via drone in Africa, or creating the first open-source database of urban infrastructure in Asia, I am keen to leverage technology to better align the public sector with the needs of the people it serves.\n\nI’m a strong believer in paying it forward and love being active in my community. I’ve received the National President’s Volunteer Service Award, launched the NY Climate Tech community to foster collaboration across climate tech, policy, and justice groups, advise the Aga Khan Development Network on economic empowerment in the Ismaili Muslim community, serve on the Women's Impact Alliance board, and volunteer with the Girl Scouts. I also founded MPower, a mentorship program for DREAMers that helps immigrant and first-gen students attend top-tier colleges.\n\nIn my free time I enjoy Citibiking, museum hopping, watching reruns of the West Wing, and getting lost in new cities and new conversations - 60 countries, thousands of people, and still counting on both fronts!\n\nStay in touch! www.sonamvelani.com",

"summary":"Dr. Tracy Fanara is a hydrologist, storm chaser, ocean scientist and public speaker, with a BS, ME, and PhD from the University of Florida’s College of Environmental Engineering. Driven by a passion to protect wildlife (and humans), Tracy takes a multidisciplinary approach to any project, problem, or research question. She has designed stormwater systems and performed flood analyses, throughout the world. She has developed water treatment technology, watershed-scale low impact designs, aquaponics for space travel, and citizen science programs with over 1.6million users to obtain publicly available environmental data. Tracy gained international media recognition due to her expertise in stormwater hydrology/nutrient transport and her research on blooms of a toxic algal species (commonly known as Florida red tide) during the 2018 Florida Water crises. Tracy is now the Coastal Modeling Portfolio Manager for the National Ocean Service of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) where she manages coastal and ocean modeling efforts to better predict earth systems and threats to human lives and livelihoods. Tracy leads Mission Tampa Bay, a DoD funded STEM camp for Middle and High school girls, and works with educators and industry to build K-12 curriculum throughout the US. Tracy spends weekends helping her wildlife expert friends rescue alligators, tag sharks, and catch invasive species. You may have seen Tracy on Discovery’s Shark Week or Mythbusters, Science Channel, National Geographic, Weather Channel, History Channel, HBO, Disney+, Fox or CBS; in Marvels Unstoppable Wasp, as a finalist to go to the moon with SpaceX Starship, or as Xylem YSI’s Mission Water, Water Hero 2020.",

"summary":"Black In Marine Science started as a week to highlight and amplify Black voices in the field and encourage younger generations, while also shedding light on the lack of diversity in marine science. After the harassment of Black birder Christian Cooper and #BlackBirdersWeek the need for #BlackinMarineScienceWeek was evident. It started with a tweet from Dr. Tiara Moore and grew to a team of organizers putting together an online event. \n\nWe hoped to have a successful week, but we were blown out of the water when we discovered that so  many people were impacted by our events!  We created a community of Black marine scientists that was much needed during the isolation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. After the rewarding turnout of #BlackinMarineScienceWeek we decided it was time to form a non-profit and continue with our goal of highlighting and amplifying Black voices! ",

"summary":"Coral Vita grows resilient corals to restore our world's dying reefs. \n\nOur company uses breakthrough methods to grow corals in months rather than decades, improve coral resiliency to deteriorating ocean conditions, and that can be scaled to supply restoration projects worldwide to turn the tide of global reef degradation. \n\nHalf of the world's reefs have died since the 1970s, and over 90% are on track to die by 2050. This isn't just an ecological catastrophe, but a socio-economic crisis: all told, coral reefs sustain 25% of marine life and the livelihoods of up to one billion people while generating $2.7 trillion annually through tourism, fisheries, and coastal protection.\n\nBy developing transformational coral farming tech and working with hotels, tourism operators, governments, re-insurers, local communities, and all other stakeholders who depend on reefs, Coral Vita's vision is to create an industry for large-scale reef restoration through our global network of land-based coral farms. Using these farms to grow corals up to 50x natural rates while enhancing their resiliency to climate change, we can improve the impact, scale and cost-effectiveness of reef restoration and help preserve coral reefs for future generations.\n\nInvited speaker to: NEXUS Global Summit, The Economist World Ocean Summit: Mexico, United Nations World Oceans Day, United Nations High-Level Event on Financing the Sustainable Development Goals, Our Ocean: Malta, The Global Climate Action Summit, The Explorers' Club World Oceans Week.",

Founded in Woods Hole, Massachusetts in 1888, the MBL is a private, nonprofit institution and an affiliate of the University of Chicago.\n\nThe MBL’s oldest and most singular strength is our convening power, attracting the world’s leading scientists and students to Woods Hole. The MBL draws a unique mix of researchers ranging from early-career scientists to Nobel Laureates, and students at levels from high school to postdoctoral. Their interactions have led to multiple, transformative breakthroughs in our understanding of biology. Once largely a feature of summers at the MBL, this convening power is now evident year-round. Well over 500 scientists and faculty are involved annually in our research and educational programs – some based at MBL full-time, some coming to the MBL for portions of the year, and some leading or lecturing in our broad range of research courses.\n\nWith a steady flow of students, scientists, and faculty participating in research projects throughout the year, enrolling in one of our research-based courses or thematic workshops, or spending an entire semester here, the special convening power of MBL is making our campus an increasingly vibrant and dynamic location year-round.",

"summary":"Sofar connects the world's oceans to power a more sustainable future. Sofar unlocks ocean data at scale. We deployed hundreds of Spotters globally to create the world’s largest privately-owned network of ocean sensors that collects 1.5 million real-time observations daily. Our team of ocean scientists assimilates this real-time data into our marine weather forecasts, which are up to 50% more accurate than traditional models.\n\nIn maritime shipping, we use these high-accuracy forecasts and vessel performance models to provide optimized guidance and save ships time, fuel, and emissions. We also equip researchers, operators, and innovators with our devices and data to power marine research and sustainable commercial solutions. Customers access data from our global sensor network and deploy our extensible Spotter platform to collect real-time surface and subsurface observations.\n\nMy role at Sofar Ocean is focused on driving new revenue and growing existing accounts across all SaaS, data, and hardware products. I also work closely with the product team to set the strategic roadmap for new developments. ",

"summary":"Cities have always been humanity’s greatest engines of opportunity, invention, and community. Home to more than half of humanity today, the world’s cities will add another 2.5 billion people by 2050. Cities are critical to our past, present, and future. \n\nThe rapid growth of cities in an ever-warming world is the biggest challenge we face. From coastal floods in New York, to red skies in San Francisco, to killer heat waves in Mumbai, climate change is no longer theoretical. It’s now impacting our streets and neighborhoods, the places we call home.  \n\nAs we adapt to and mitigate the consequences of this changing reality, our cities are at the forefront of the race against climate change. Approximately 75% of the urban infrastructure of 2050 is yet to be built, representing a $5 trillion market opportunity. How we design our built environment - our buildings, transportation systems, waste management processes, food chains, power grids, and public spaces - will have a profound influence on the livability of our communities.\n\nAt Streetlife Ventures, we are the ultimate optimists and are excited to work with founders and policymakers to build the future we want to live in.",

"summary":"Continuing Walter Munk’s Legacy of daring exploration and discovery through scientific research, education and ocean conservation.\n\nBased in La Jolla, California and established in 2017, The Walter Munk Foundation for the Oceans was founded by Walter and Mary Munk to continue Walter's legacy of daring exploration and discovery in the field of oceanography.\n\nThrough the Foundation, Walter Munk established partnerships with leading researchers in Baja California, Mexico working to understand and protect the vulnerable M. munkiana species of ray — named after Walter. Walter and Mary also selected Lake Altaussee, Austria to begin comprehensive long-term studies with leading Austrian researchers about the lake’s history, geology, ecology and response to climate change.\n\nFollowing Walter’s death in 2019 at the age of 101, the scientists and educators at WMFO continue Walter's legacy of education and outreach. Today the Walter Munk Foundation for the Ocean supports the enduring programs Walter and Mary started, with a renewed focus for developing engaging, exciting and impactful ocean science and education initiatives. Join us!",

"description":"Hello Louis! I was a part of the 3rd Seaworthy Cohort and also a post-doc at FIU Institute of environment. Saw your panel this week at the FIU Reseearch conference and hoped to connect after and miss you! Would love to connect. I have an exciting installation of floating flowers occuring in Pinecrest between Feb-March that I think could be an exciting story to share. Would love to share more. My website is greenthumbsfl.com; e-mail info@greenthumbsfl.com. NBC covered the initial story last year during earth day, maybe we can shoot for an update on this years earth day :) https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/national-international/earth-week/fiu-researchers-using-unexpected-tool-to-clean-dirty-canals-south-florida/3289895/",
