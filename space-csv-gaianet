We believe the answers are in our communities and all around us: they’re simply disconnected from the resources they need (and from one another.) \n\nOur What\nWe believe that when equipped with our greatest resource of all—one another—each and every one of us is capable of supporting our capacity to thrive. So we’re weaving a multi-sided ecosystem that empowers us all, where we are, with what we have, to be the greatest lever for change. \n\nWe innovate social, technical, and financial tools that support our ability to collectively innovate on, resource, and apply solutions to the world’s most pressing issues. \n\nOur first tool is Open Impact, a platform that coordinates and connects on-the-ground efforts, transparently measures their progress, and matches them with the resources they need to scale—whether it’s capital, skills, or knowledge. We’re currently modeling and refining with 170 organizations in 16 countries. \n\nWe believe that true resilience scales many-to-many, and that we each have a unique part to play in this movement-of-movements. We see everything we do as an example and an opportunity for learning, and strive to hold contexts for radical humility: giving us the freedom to design not for the answers we think we know, but for the processes of evolving together when we try, fail, and learn the first, second, and hundredth time. We also believe deeply in collective and long-term stewardship, and strive to align our systems of decisionmaking and reciprocity with a thriving world for future generations.\n\nWe strive to support the local exchange of resources, and the global exchange of knowledge, and we thank you for being a part of that exchange with us.

Join us in turning the World into Paradise.\n\nBased on our \"normal life experience\", we might believe that constant decline is the only option. Most things we do have a negative impact. Yet we just assume that it is \"the cost of doing business\". \n\n\n\nFrom 'driving your car' to 'buying things' at the store. There is almost always a negative impact attached to our actions. There is nothing wrong with the idea of 'transportation' or 'commerce', but the way we do it, we cause the destruction of the only physical home we have.\n\n\n\nThe Earth. The environmental crisis, suicide rates, plastic in all eco systems, water- and air-pollution, the 6th mass extinction, health epidemic, institutions and democracies breaking down, are all but symptoms of the emergence of a new paradigm.\n\nImagine a world where 3 trees get planted for every tree that get's cut down. Where 3 pounds of trash get taken out of the ocean automatically for every pound of \"product\" (future trash) that gets bought or produced.\n\n\n\nImagine a world, where for every interaction, with every product and service, we make the world a little better than it was before.\n\n\n\nNow extrapolate this new Paradigm to 7.8 billion people and imagine where humanity could be in 10 years: how about in 100 years? In short: PARADISE.\n\nInstead of minimizing our Negative Impact, we are here to maximize our Net Positive Impact.\n\n\n,Paradise Syndicate

Specifically, EcoCiv supports local partners in the process of designing and implementing more effective and efficient solutions in particular locations (“hubs”), and then aims to prompt the replication and scaling of those solutions in other locations.

Drawing on libertarian socialist ideas and real-world examples throughout history, their motivation was to inspire hope, inform strategy and to demonstrate that a viable and better alternative to the two dominant economic systems of the last century, capitalism and a command economy, is possible.\n\nBefore designing new institutions, first we need to be clear what values a desirable economy should be based on. The key values of a participatory economy are defined as:\n\nSelf-Management\n= For every individual to have a say in a decision based on the degree that they are affected by it.\n\nMore\nJustice\n= To fairly share burdens and benefits so that any differences in income from work are based on differences in effort or sacrifice.\n\nMore\nSolidarity\n= To foster an awareness of shared interests, togetherness and concern for the well-being of others.\n\nMore\nEnvironmental Sustainability\n= To nurture our natural environment and protect it for future generations through conservation and sustainable practices.\n\nMore\nEfficiency\n= To use our scarce resources and human talents wherever they return the greatest increase in human well-being.\n\nMore\nDiversity\n= To recognise that each individual is unique and to create a large variety of options for people to fulfill their lives\n,Participatory Economy Project

People's health and wellbeing will be prioritized over transportation and infrastructure, unlike traditional cities. Only 200 meters wide, but 170 kilometers long and 500 meters above sea level.\n\nTHE LINE will eventually accommodate 9 million people and will be built on a footprint of just 34 square kilometers. This will mean a reduced infrastructure footprint, creating never-before-seen efficiencies in city functions.

At Arcosanti, we pursue this mission through experimentation and application of the principles of arcology, a combination of the words architecture and ecology that offers an alternative to urban sprawl.\n\nLocated in the heart of central Arizona, Arcosanti is only an hour’s drive from Phoenix, Flagstaff, Prescott, and Sedona—an easy day trip or a convenient stopping point on any road trip. You can visit us in person almost every day of the year, enjoying guided tours, hiking trails, and a café where you can enjoy breakfast and lunch much of the week. We also invite you to explore our website, follow us on social media, and sign up for our newsletter to learn more.\n\nFrom blending the Italian words “cosa” and “anti,” meaning “against things,” Soleri named both his architectural design studio and the nonprofit foundation he founded “Cosanti,” as a deliberate critique of the rampant culture of consumerism he saw taking hold in the world. Cosanti – whether as a place of imaginative, provocative architectural experiments or a foundation exploring a built world in balance with the environment – both embody a radically different perspective and aesthetic.\n\nIn 1970, The Cosanti Foundation began construction of Arcosanti, a prototype arcology in the higher-elevation Arizona desert that proved to become a testing ground for Soleri’s progressive urban planning concepts. Over the subsequent decades, workshop volunteers, known as Arcosanti Alumni, began to build the iconic architecture of the Arcosanti we know today.\n\nThough the original design of Arcosanti is described in Arcology: The City in the Image of Man, Soleri’s magnum opus on arcology, called for a place where thousands of people would live and work, Arcosanti has never been occupied by more than 100 people. Despite that, it continues to be regarded as an early example of sustainable architecture and vertically-dense building that prioritized live-work spaces and the surrounding natural environment over urban sprawl. Dubbed “the urban laboratory” in the 1970s by famed New York Times architecture critic Ada Louise Huxtable, Arcosanti continues to experiment and test its own potential as a working alternative to urban sprawl, erosion of communities, and neglect of the environment while supporting its residents to lead lives that are enriched socially, energetically, and economically.\n,Arcosanti
