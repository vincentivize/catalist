"description":"Re-imagining value using commons logic\\n\\nWhat are we doing?\\nFor more than a year we, a group of stewards of different open networks and communities, have met every week to discuss new forms of wealth. This process has brought these organizations closer together, as we have discovered ways to bridge our activities. We are now moving towards integrating our activities, turning our complementarity into true synergy. In essence, we are building a true ecosystem of open networks, communities and DAOs.\\nCurrently, our organizations build p2p culture, engage in education about p2p, develop new collaborative innovation and entrepreneurship models, practice material commons-based peer production for hardware development, develop new p2p media models and build IT infrastructure to support p2p activities. By weaving a web of relations between these organizations and by building channels for information and resource flows among them we will create new capacity for the p2p society.\\n\\nWhat is our short summary?\\nWe are going through a phase transition, moving from an archipelago of friendly open organizations to a tight-knit ecosystem.\\n\\nWhere are we starting?\\nWe are all participating in Gitcoin GR13 to fuel this phase transition.\\nWe are also starting to prototype IT infrastructure to support this transition (Vincent created a sandbox Trove to start experimenting here)\\n\\nWhat might this look like?\\nA tight-knit ecosystem of complementary open organizations. A network of networks, able to engage effectively in p2p cultural and economic production.\\n\\nWhat are the goals?\\n- Create the conjunctive tissue for a glocal p2p culture and regenerative types of relational microeconomies.\\n- Create an ecology of open networks and DAOs, web3.\\n- Create infrastructure for this glocal p2p culture and economy: tools for keeping records, visualization, resource flows, reputation, …\\n",
