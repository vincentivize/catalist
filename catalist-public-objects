According to the theory, historical events are associated with recurring generational personas (archetypes). Each generational persona unleashes a new era (called a turning) lasting around 20–25 years, in which a new social, political, and economic climate (mood) exists. They are part of a larger cyclical \"saeculum\" (a long human life, which usually spans between 80 and 100 years, although some saecula have lasted longer). The theory states that a crisis recurs in American history after every saeculum, which is followed by a recovery (high). During this recovery, institutions and communitarian values are strong. Ultimately, succeeding generational archetypes attack and weaken institutions in the name of autonomy and individualism, which eventually creates a tumultuous political environment that ripens conditions for another crisis.,Strauss–Howe generational theory

Looking to the detrimental cooking of our past, and the misguided dining of our present, Barber points to a future “third plate”: a new form of American eating where good farming and good food intersect.

We believe the answers are in our communities and all around us: they’re simply disconnected from the resources they need (and from one another.) \n\nOur What\nWe believe that when equipped with our greatest resource of all—one another—each and every one of us is capable of supporting our capacity to thrive. So we’re weaving a multi-sided ecosystem that empowers us all, where we are, with what we have, to be the greatest lever for change. \n\nWe innovate social, technical, and financial tools that support our ability to collectively innovate on, resource, and apply solutions to the world’s most pressing issues. \n\nOur first tool is Open Impact, a platform that coordinates and connects on-the-ground efforts, transparently measures their progress, and matches them with the resources they need to scale—whether it’s capital, skills, or knowledge. We’re currently modeling and refining with 170 organizations in 16 countries. \n\nWe believe that true resilience scales many-to-many, and that we each have a unique part to play in this movement-of-movements. We see everything we do as an example and an opportunity for learning, and strive to hold contexts for radical humility: giving us the freedom to design not for the answers we think we know, but for the processes of evolving together when we try, fail, and learn the first, second, and hundredth time. We also believe deeply in collective and long-term stewardship, and strive to align our systems of decisionmaking and reciprocity with a thriving world for future generations.\n\nWe strive to support the local exchange of resources, and the global exchange of knowledge, and we thank you for being a part of that exchange with us. You can learn more about our ethics and organizing principles below. \n,Open Future Coalition

With our holistic approach to landscape restoration - the 4 Returns framework - anyone can work with nature and their local community to restore a landscape at scale.\n\nLandscape degradation is at the heart of the world's biggest problems. Affecting a third of the world's population, it is a major contributor to food insecurity, water scarcity, climate change and biodiversity loss, destroying the ecosystems we all rely upon to survive. We facilitate landscape restoration from the ground up. From farmers to business owners, policymakers to NGOs, we work with a diverse range of partners to protect and restore landscapes across the world. To make the greatest impact, we are also building a global movement to accelerate holistic landscape restoration via our 4 Returns framework.\n,Commonland

Programmatic work at the intersection of local actions and theory on root causes is often the missing piece in efforts to establish an ecological civilization that serves the wellbeing of people and the planet.\n\nEcoCiv aggregates and amplifies existing solutions or actions, connecting dots between siloed issues and breaking down barriers in order to catalyze action. Specifically, EcoCiv supports local partners in the process of designing and implementing more effective and efficient solutions in particular locations (“hubs”), and then aims to prompt the replication and scaling of those solutions in other locations. The goal of these interventions is that an increasing number of communities make measurable progress toward a just and sustainable society.\n,Institute for Ecological Civilization

All this comes before looking at the person’s knowledge, talents, desires, contacts; and even before knowing their history, work or projects.\n\nIn WINfinity Inquiry Clusters, we practice HOW we connect with each other before exploring WHAT we are each about.

Drawing on libertarian socialist ideas and real-world examples throughout history, their motivation was to inspire hope, inform strategy and to demonstrate that a viable and better alternative to the two dominant economic systems of the last century, capitalism and a command economy, is possible.\n\nBefore designing new institutions, first we need to be clear what values a desirable economy should be based on. The key values of a participatory economy are defined as:\n\nSelf-Management\n= For every individual to have a say in a decision based on the degree that they are affected by it.\n\nMore\nJustice\n= To fairly share burdens and benefits so that any differences in income from work are based on differences in effort or sacrifice.\n\nMore\nSolidarity\n= To foster an awareness of shared interests, togetherness and concern for the well-being of others.\n\nMore\nEnvironmental Sustainability\n= To nurture our natural environment and protect it for future generations through conservation and sustainable practices.\n\nMore\nEfficiency\n= To use our scarce resources and human talents wherever they return the greatest increase in human well-being.\n\nMore\nDiversity\n= To recognise that each individual is unique and to create a large variety of options for people to fulfill their lives\n,Participatory Economy Project

A lover of all things technical, musical, and educational.  I'm  based out of Silicon Valley in California and have worked for Amazon Web Services, Slalom Consulting, Microsoft, Cisco Systems, the Wounded Warrior Project, and Google over the last 15 years.  I originally hail from the south side of the south side of Chicago but I left there and went West in 2005.  At my day job, I daily bring my technical and business leadership skills to work to help my customers and clients digitally transform their businesses using cloud computing, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and mobile technologies.  \n\nI received lots of helping hands as I grew up and developed.  Because of this, I have a deep passion for K-12 education and for my community in both Chicago and the Bay Area.  To affect change for underprivileged communities (like the one I come from), I have been a board member of the San Jose Repertory Theater, Silicon Valley Education Foundation, ALearn, and a board fellow at College Track and the Mural Music and Arts Project.\n\nI proudly hold an M.B.A. from the University of California Berkeley (Go Bears) and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign (I-L-L).

Dr. Francis was named one of Education Week’s 2020 Leaders to Learn From and has been committed to improving learning environments for STEAM education in Title I schools for her entire career. Beginning her education career as an elementary teacher for Atlanta Public Schools, Dr. Francis developed an after-school science club and a monthly science initiative to increase science learning opportunities for under-represented students. Inspired by the lack of high quality science instruction observed during student teaching, her Spelman College senior thesis presented ways to improve science instruction in Title 1 schools, and led her to continue that inquiry through her Ph.D in Educational Theory and Practice from the University of Georgia with a dissertation that focused on the ways in which race and gender limit exposure to high quality science instruction. \n\nDr. Francis brings a wealth of knowledge to the role as a former elementary teacher, former faculty member at Spelman College where she taught Math and Science methods to teacher candidates and as a district administrator well versed in the needs of novice teachers and equitable learning environments. Coupling these experiences with her past support of STE(A)M Truck since 2015, first as a STEAM Designer and recently as a thought partner and professional development consultant, Dr. Francis is leveraging corporate partnerships with giants like Micron and Snipes to ensure youth of Metro Atlanta have high quality engagement and exposure to explore the myriad opportunities in STEAM.,Dr. Marsha  Francis

It redefines the concept of urban development and what cities of the future should look like.\n\nNo roads, cars or emissions, it will run on 100% renewable energy and 95% of land will be preserved for nature. People's health and wellbeing will be prioritized over transportation and infrastructure, unlike traditional cities. Only 200 meters wide, but 170 kilometers long and 500 meters above sea level.\n\nTHE LINE will eventually accommodate 9 million people and will be built on a footprint of just 34 square kilometers. This will mean a reduced infrastructure footprint, creating never-before-seen efficiencies in city functions. The ideal climate all-year-round will ensure that residents can enjoy the surrounding nature. Residents will also have access to all facilities within a five-minute walk, in addition to high-speed rail – with an end-to-end transit of 20 minutes.,NEOM The Line

At Arcosanti, we pursue this mission through experimentation and application of the principles of arcology, a combination of the words architecture and ecology that offers an alternative to urban sprawl.\n\nLocated in the heart of central Arizona, Arcosanti is only an hour’s drive from Phoenix, Flagstaff, Prescott, and Sedona—an easy day trip or a convenient stopping point on any road trip. You can visit us in person almost every day of the year, enjoying guided tours, hiking trails, and a café where you can enjoy breakfast and lunch much of the week. We also invite you to explore our website, follow us on social media, and sign up for our newsletter to learn more.\n\nFrom blending the Italian words “cosa” and “anti,” meaning “against things,” Soleri named both his architectural design studio and the nonprofit foundation he founded “Cosanti,” as a deliberate critique of the rampant culture of consumerism he saw taking hold in the world. Cosanti – whether as a place of imaginative, provocative architectural experiments or a foundation exploring a built world in balance with the environment – both embody a radically different perspective and aesthetic.\n\nIn 1970, The Cosanti Foundation began construction of Arcosanti, a prototype arcology in the higher-elevation Arizona desert that proved to become a testing ground for Soleri’s progressive urban planning concepts. Over the subsequent decades, workshop volunteers, known as Arcosanti Alumni, began to build the iconic architecture of the Arcosanti we know today.\n\nThough the original design of Arcosanti is described in Arcology: The City in the Image of Man, Soleri’s magnum opus on arcology, called for a place where thousands of people would live and work, Arcosanti has never been occupied by more than 100 people. Despite that, it continues to be regarded as an early example of sustainable architecture and vertically-dense building that prioritized live-work spaces and the surrounding natural environment over urban sprawl. Dubbed “the urban laboratory” in the 1970s by famed New York Times architecture critic Ada Louise Huxtable, Arcosanti continues to experiment and test its own potential as a working alternative to urban sprawl, erosion of communities, and neglect of the environment while supporting its residents to lead lives that are enriched socially, energetically, and economically.\n,Arcosanti

It also illustrates the idea that transcending one’s paradigm is the result of a disciplined effort to move up levels. Because each level of paradigm represents an evolution of understanding beyond the paradigms that preceded it, work at the top level yields the greatest power and leverage.\n\nThe four levels are: Regenerate Life,Do Good,Arrest Disorder,Value Return\nLevels of Paradigm\n\nRegenerate Life\nDo Good\n----------------\nArrest Disorder\nValue Return\n\nA framework like this one allows individuals and institutions to discern which paradigms are informing their decisions, giving them the opportunity to discover the dissonances between what they intend and what they actually do.

Ethics are culturally evolved mechanisms that regulate self-interest, giving us a better understanding of good and bad outcomes.\n\nThe greater the power of humans, the more critical ethics become for long-term cultural and biological survival.\n\nPermaculture ethics are distilled from research into community ethics, learning from cultures that have existed in relative balance with their environment for much longer than more recent civilisations.\n\nThis does not mean that we should ignore the great teachings of modern times, but in the transition to a sustainable future, we need to consider values and concepts outside the current social norm.[[list \"['Frameworks' = 'Permaculture Ethics']\"]],Permaculture Ethics

This journey builds skills and resilience at home and in our local communities that will help us prepare for an uncertain future with less available energy.\n\nThe techniques and strategies used to apply these principles vary widely depending on the location, climatic conditions and resources that are available. The methods may differ, but the foundations to this wholistic approach remain constant. By learning these principles you can acquire valuable thinking tools that help you become more resilient in an era of change.\n\nThe foundations of permaculture are the ethics (centre) which guide the use of the 12 design principles, ensuring that they are used in appropriate ways. These principles are seen as universal, although the methods used to express them will vary greatly according to the place and situation. They are applicable to our personal, economic, social and political reorganisation as illustrated in the permaculture flower.\n\nEach principle can be thought of as a door that opens into whole systems thinking, providing a different perspective that can be understood at varying levels of depth and application.[[list \"['Frameworks' = 'Permaculture Principles']\"]],Permaculture Principles

Regenerative sustainability (RS), the next wave of sustainability, includes and transcends these goals, aiming for thriving living systems in which whole-system health and wellbeing increase continually. A key difference between sustainability paradigms is the thinking underlying them, with regenerative sustainability based on a holistic worldview and paradigm, integrating recent understandings from science and practice,\ndifferent ways of knowing, and inner and outer dimensions of sustainability necessary for systemic transformation.   RS, practiced through regenerative development and design for over 50 years, aligns  human  consciousness  and  actions  with  living  systems  principles.   When  this  alignment occurs, sustainable development goals are elevated to become regenerative development goals, with living systems principles and characteristics guiding the development of regenerative indicators and strategies made specific to a place through transformational co-creative processes. We should aim for regenerative sustainability because it off\ners holistic approaches based on how thriving living systems function, addresses the root causes of (un)sustainability, and is inherently more inspiring and motivational. Advancing regenerative sustainability will require fundamental shifts supported by more awareness and education, theoretical and practical development, leadership, empowering communities, and integrating spirituality.\n[[list \"['Frameworks' = 'Regenerative Development Goals']\"]],Regenerative Development Goals

For example, water and health are interrelated and by solving for the water challenge, the health challenge becomes much more addressable. Solving for energy makes water solvable, which makes ending hunger much easier, and that has direct effects on security. And so on. The GGCs are also interdependent. For example, any solution to the food challenge necessarily requires doing so in an environmentally sustainable manner.

This report presents the conclusions of our six-month open consultation process to define common metrics for sustainable value creation.\nThe core and expanded set of “Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics” and disclosures can be used by companies to align their mainstream reporting on performance against environmental, social and governance (ESG) indicators and track their contributions towards the SDGs on a consistent basis. The metrics are deliberately based on existing standards, with the near-term objectives of accelerating convergence among the leading private standard-setters and bringing greater comparability and consistency to the reporting of ESG disclosures.[[list \"['Frameworks' = 'WEF Metrics and Pillars for Stakeholder Capitalism']\"]],WEF Metrics and Pillars for Stakeholder Capitalism

One chooses a sector (or more) according to one’s heart’s passion, one's \"compass of joy\", what one loves to do and just has to keep doing. Through \"vocational arousal\", like-minded souls collaborate to design, develop, and manifest new ideas and systemics. Co-creating happens in small focused and committed groups (evolutionary \"leadership hubs\" and \"sector hubs\") where individuals come together in resonance and mutual respect, honor the genius within one another, and work toward the kind of world of which we have previously only dreamed.\n\nThe Wheel of Co-Creation comprises 12 areas of social life and serves as a map for synergistic convergence (Syncon). We connect and synchronize in the respective areas what is innovative and creative and what works. Moreover, we can create something new by enabling a new, functioning, healthy whole through new connections and a reorganization of old forms and patterns. This model is used to transform the systems in all sectors. Thus we consider not only the 12 sectors in their current state but also look out for what emerges. This lets us know where social evolution will go.

While mainstream economics has resulted in a rich body of mathematical theory and public policy practice over a long history, over the years several fault lines and limitations have also surfaced which are now being addressed by novel interdisciplinary approaches such as complexity theory, behavioral economics, econophysics, quantum decision theory, etc.,Centre for Complexity Economics, Applied Spirituality and Public Policy (CEASP)

Change is constant. The world is in a continual state of flux. It is a stream of ever-mutating, emergent patterns. Rather than steel ourselves against such change, this book invites us to feel, map, assess, and learn from the swirling patterns around us in order to better understand and influence them as they happen. This is a resolutely materialist “spirituality” based equally on science and science fiction, a visionary incantation to transform that which ultimately transforms us.,Book: Emergent Strategy

The aim of catalytic capital is to unlock impact and additional investment that would not otherwise be possible, strengthening communities, expanding opportunity and economic growth, and fueling innovation that advances the well-being of people and the planet, while laying the groundwork for mainstream investors to participate in transformative investments.\n\nTo make substantial progress toward a more just, inclusive, and resilient world, we need more catalytic capital to flow. The Catalytic Capital Consortium, or C3, aims to demonstrate the power of this form of investment to extend and deepen the reach of the impact investing field, helping to address the annual funding shortfall of $2.5 trillion in developing countries alone that is hindering the world from reaching the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The initiative is helping a select group of outstanding, diverse funds address some of the world’s most pressing challenges, while also building knowledge, awareness, and use of catalytic capital globally.,Catalytic Capital Consortium

Our online existence is filled with complexities, passwords, and the constant threat of predators. Junk mail, ads, disinformation, and fear mongering consume our attention. Software adds more misery with unwanted calls, scams, and frustrating help. We have normalized to a culture of junk, violence, riots, manipulation, and neglect.\n\nThis is an absurd way for our species to treat itself. Very few other species behave in such a manner. We are intelligent beings who have accomplished much for ourselves.\n\nLet's declare that this is a problem we will solve: Create a thriving world that prioritizes the long-term well-being of all of us, not just a few. We set aside the stories that tell us it's impossible. Our lives filled with meaning, passion, and self-expression.

Additionally, many historical accelerators have shifted from being true pre-seed catalysts to programs overly focused on existing traction to optimize follow-on funding hit rates. This is a hyper-focused program with high engagement from the NextView partners and our close knit industry leading advisors.

A few key areas that really make us stand out: Bootcamp Model: We've taken our highest value content, mentors, and partners and packaged them up to fit companies needs. Startups need access to content when it's relevant to them, not all at once. We plan to change and evolve the offering based on the needs of alumni and companies applying. Housing is included during each bootcamp for two founders. See our list of bootcamps below.Continued Access: Once companies apply and are accepted to a TVA Bootcamp, they have access to any future bootcamps. Note: TVA can only provide housing for one bootcamp per company.Diversity & Stage: The standard accelerator model biases itself towards younger, single, and extremely early stage ventures. We're proud to have over 50% of applicants with a female founder and an average age of 37. The average company in 2019 had over $300k in established revenue the year prior.Flexible Funding: The traditional equity & convertible note structure doesn't work for some companies.Equity: Those with high-growth ambitions and potential, and who will likely require additional outside capital. We offer founder-friendly warrants with no maturity dates, just a pre-defined % based on a valuation. Our standard offer for early stage companies raising their first round is $30k for 5% which converts after raising $200k in additional capital. Companies must be established as C-Corps.Revenue Based Investments (RBI): Many companies don't fit the profile of traditional venture capital but still require investment. This alternative fills the gap between traditional debt and high-growth equity and is highly aligned with the growth and seasonalities of each business. An example might be $30k in an RBI note, deferred repayment until the company increases revenue by 50%, at which point the company repays the RBI at 5% per month until it hits a 2.5X repayment cap. Great for LLCs or C-Corps.Fee Based: Don't want to give up equity or don't need investment at this time? A great option for founders looking for a \"mini-MBA\" type experience to help them build their companies. Each bootcamp will have a fee between $1k and $1,500.00 for two people. Housing is included.,Telluride Venture Accelerator

What projects are being worked on by those in this community?  Where might there be opportunities for collaboration, especially because it seems like more than one person is working on the same thing? How can we discover the synergies more quickly?\"  In essence, people want to share their expertise and their projects, people need to see the whole community more clearly to be able to choose where they fit,  and we all need to speed this up to use resources more wisely and scale the great work that is already happening. \n\nExisting solutions are often maps that are curated by only a few people and cannot be edited by all members and so quickly become high-maintenance or fall out-of-date. It's obvious this isn't scalable or sustainable.\n\nSo until we have the technological innovation to accomplish our ideal maps, the Tapestry Project was designed to fill the void in the interim.  Tapestry view offers a simple X / Y axis, spreading out all the pieces so we can get a good look and it is editable by every member of the community. ,Tapestry

I've been a member of this group for a couple of weeks now. I have not been active besides a small message at the beginning and some one-on-one contact with some members. The reason was that I took this opportunity to finish an essay that would offer a birdseye view on my project Smartup Zero. I needed a group like this to finish it up finally (nobody gives me deadlines). I wanted to offer something first before joining conversations and discussions. The other reason was that I wanted to get a feeling with the talking points in this group. For me the concept of 'system innovators' was new but the more I read about it and listing in on conversations on Clubhouse and in this chat, the more I got convinced I finally found out what type of entrepreneur I am (a System Innovator!!!) and that there are many others like me. It really felt like a blessing and gave me new energy to give my vision a third try to come off the ground. I hope some of you find it interesting and are willing to help me validate it through discussion and assessments. In this google doc you have the opportunity to add comments for insights/questions/remarks while reading it. little bit about Schep (34). Based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. I live a minimalistic life with my husky Jax. I have a mind full of big ideas but mostly a heart that is beating to create change on a fundamental level. As a technology designer, I focus on how to change people mindsets by giving them a different digital toolset. I believe there is a higher purpose for the smartphone. I have been exploring that idea through prototyping and experimenting new types of technologies since 2013. I also make music and films. Here you can see a short film (4 min) I made with my best friend during the first lockdown in Amsterdam (). There you can also see my dog and here my music. Subtitles are available in this clip. I am looking forward to getting more active here and join discussions and conversations. Also, I realize there is somewhat of a 'summer break' for most people in here. So timing is maybe not the best. Nonetheless, I didn't want to wait with stepping forward and speak up. Lots of love for all of you here! One thing is for sure: we all want to change the systems in our societies that each are causing and upholding thousands of problems. Seems to me the right way forward: change the system instead of playing whack-a-mole with each problem individually. cheers, Robbert\n,Telegram message from Robbert Schep

Recognising this moment in the long arc of historical shift.Let's go co-project the dreams and intentions within our humanity like it's hindsight.❈De-program each-other, imagine with a clarity, and prompt human and machine in fractal loops of possibility. 🦾Lets set the pace of resonance and recognition for history.I invite you to act on that belief you're holding a key piece of this puzzle, because I know for a fact there's so many people in this group that are. 🧩We've all spoken about these topics in the past in our clubhouse sessions. And now I'm inviting any of you who feel the call to come join me here putting these ideas into serious playful action. Feel free to hmu if you have any questions and link me to anyone you know based in berlin always looking for new collaborators that think in our field of thought.+ also please follow any intuition to pass this on 🙏\n,Telegram message from Alex Kennedy

They are getting closer to driving mathematical models for emergence. Based on non-reciprocity, which may be counter-intuitive for peacenicks but matches the pay-it-forward mechanic underlying Sqale.

Bob has been forecasting what we are now referring to as the Metaverse since 1968, when IFTF was first founded to explore the future impacts of the newly invented Arpanet, the predecessor to the internet and now the metaverse. Bob will share some of the forecasts from the 50+ years IFTF has been asking, how will these emerging technologies and we will discuss what we got right, what we missed, and what we should be thinking about as we step into this new immersive, nested and interconnected computing paradigm.“The Emerging Media Lab at IFTF, led by director Toshi Anders Hoo, carries forth IFTF’s 50+ year history of curating provocative conversations about the long term impacts of technology on how we live, learn, work, play, share, own and govern. The Metaverse Perspectives Series will build on IFTF’s legacy of bringing a diverse collection of thinkers, practitioners, visionaries and critics to imagine and question the possible futures of this next evolution in immersive, interconnected and emergent communication systems. In each episode we will explore a new topic, hear from diverse voices, and get an early peek into some of the new technologies and platforms that are combining to create the various components, communities and worlds that are coalescing to become the metaverse.”\n,Telegram message from Charles Blass

After all, successful creators, influencers and crypto projects already thrive in a context of post-employment free agency. Swarms of talent, community and capital already flock from project to project, and this has been true about open source for decades. Perhaps over time, as these projects become better funded and proven successful, the corporate world itself will be ‘eaten’ or at least transformed by this capital-charged collab culture. Companies and projects might become more like clouds, larger than ever before but with vaguer outlines, eroding the boundaries between employees, consultants, customers and investors. Index funds of project tokens, maybe selected and weighted by algorithms, could become a major factor in venture finance. Like creator fandom today, every ‘company’ or project will become more like a tribe, driven and defined by the stories and symbols linking its members together, led by those who best weave its narrative\"\n,Telegram message from Alex Kennedy

Together with Nesta’s Centre for Collective Intelligence Design, we at the United Nations Development Programme recognize that in order for governments of the world to achieve these goals, we need to get smarter by harnessing the knowledge of almost 8 billion people on the planet.  This report is a call to make it standard practice to channel the innovations, knowledge and contributions of people across the globe, to get serious about the move toward real time data, and to find responsible ways of using artificial intelligence to elevate human intelligence.  If we want to put this planet on a more sustainable & equitable path, we need to get smarter together. At the United Nations, we support, accompany and learn from governments, community groups, development partners, businesses and individuals doing their part to reach the Sustainable Development Goals. We see real time knowledge creation, collective action and intelligence-driven decision making as essential. This is why, together with our founding investors from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Qatar and many others, we’re building a social innovation capability through our network of 91 social innovation labs inside the United Nations serving 115 countries. Our starting point is that no country, no government, no organization has the full blueprint for success.  We all need to learn what works and what doesn’t to drive inclusion and sustainability in global development.   This is why we need to tap into the intelligence that drives the actions of almost 8 billion people: to create break-throughs that transform the systems that will determine whether future generations can meet their needs. We designed Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development: Getting Smarter Together as a study on the practice of pooling collective brain power to create a better balance among equity, environmental protection and economic prosperity. It is the first such research to unpack the value of collective intelligence design for distributed problem solving, real time environmental monitoring and new forms of accountability. These and other use cases described are part of the action we must take to drive progress on global sustainability goals and address the challenges we face as people and as a planet. Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development: Getting Smarter Together surveys the activities of over 200 organizations to pool distributed knowledge to advance the sustainable development goals by building accountable institutions, protecting and restoring ecosystems and conserving the oceans.13 Case Studies is an in depth exploration of how the UNDP Accelerator Labs - the world’s largest learning network - is using ethnography, innovation challenges, citizen science and machine learning to advance the global goals - primarily to make cities inclusive and safe and ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.I invite you to read Getter Smarter Together as an invitation to participate in this effort to mobilize intelligence to advance the Sustainable Development Goals so that 9 years from now we can look at their achievement as the basis for a more inclusive and sustainable planet.”Achim SteinerUnited Nations Development Programme Administrator\n,Telegram message from Charles Blass

Tointroduce more colorful terms, the goal of the HDM project is tomake a simulation of mathematics that surpasses \"real\" mathematicsin possibility.“The first objective of the project is to systematically transposeall extant mathematics into free hypertext. Optical characterrecognition software that works on mathematical text, mathematicallanguage parsing software, and hypertext generating software arethree stepping stones that I think could help achieve thisobjective. These tools would allow one to transform print-basedmathematical text into electronic hypertext automatically.”\n,Telegram message from Charles Blass

Some of us are coming together around open data standards for systems change agents. The goal is to start growing domain-specific ontologies as well as an upper meta-ontology that will make resource and database sharing between regenerative organizations and projects possible through the Global Brain Connectome. Catalist is a web2 solution that can be a hub for databases that use the same ontology and can manage permissions for sharing information across aligned organizations. Anyone interested in all-win database ontology design or wanting to align their databases with a unified ontology, please join this chat!

P2C provides gamers and game developers with animal-inspired assets and incentives based on real-world wildlife data. Proceeds from in-game sales of these assets directly benefit conservancies and nature stewards, completing the ecological loop. Our goal is to gamify worldwide eco-data through a Decentralised Ecological Economics Protocol (DEEP), which turns dynamic wildlife data into actionable gaming assets that fund and sustain conservation efforts around the globe.,Sovereign Nature Initiative

The majority of nonprofits lack operating reserves and access to savings or investments, leading to a loss of trust and fewer donations. Blockchain can address these issues by channeling more funding to local impactful organizations and allowing nonprofits worldwide to fundraise from a global audience. By investing in tokenized assets, nonprofits can provide for themselves in perpetuity, while donors can see the impact of their dollars grow. By democratizing access to financial opportunity, blockchain technology can lead to a more just and equitable world where local organizations on the ground get the sustainable funding they need to drive impactful solutions.,Chauncey St. John

With the  globalization of ayahuasca it was important for me to make a film to show how Amazonian indigenous peoples use ayahuasca, to be guided by their wisdom, to inspire reciprocity, and to preserve sacred reverence for ayahuasca. \n\nIn collaboration with Amazonian spiritual leaders and contemporary scientists, Ayahuasca Diaries, a feature documentary anticipates the future of ayahuasca in a distinctive groundbreaking style. From the ways the psychedelic elixir transforms personal lives to how it’s changing world culture and helping to save the Amazon, Ayahuasca Diaries is for both the curious and well-seasoned.\n,Maxi Cohen

Decent work and economic growth,10.

The only options available to them are so costly that they result in high rates of defaults and/or perpetual debt entrapment. This cyclical spiral results in a chronic lack of liquidity and underemployment, which severely constrain economic growth and human development in many regions around the world.  The estimated unmet demand for credit in these markets is 5.2T, which traditional finance has proven inadequate to address. Innovative financial models within the collaborative finance umbrella are better suited for tackling this problem because they don’t rely solely on external capital sources to bootstrap funding, and thus lower the cost of credit. I will share about our team’s contribution to collaborative finance, the stable credit protocol, which provides communities the tools they need to build a more self-reliant credit system and improve their local economy, while simultaneously gaining access to the global financial network. \n,Sayer Tindall

We harness the power of the sun and the power of the blockchain to deliver real-world impact by providing reliable and affordable access to clean electricity while reducing CO2e and increasing climate resilience.\n\nWe believe decentralized, clean energy is a public good, and we’ve witnessed how small solar solutions unlock tangible benefits including community agency, self-sufficiency and climate resilience. We work to ensure that no one is left behind in the transition to renewables, especially climate-vulnerable people in rural sub-Saharan Africa—people experiencing increasingly severe climate effects while contributing the least to the climate crisis.\n\nThe Solar Foundation has completed off-grid solar projects in Uganda, Nigeria and Puerto Rico (please see the Solar Foundation website for details and pictures). We are currently planning a novel community solar + UBI pilot project with GoodDollar and an impact certs project using Switch to monitor our solar data for retroactive funding,Coleen Chase

They are barriers to opportunity, implementation, and collaboration for people, solutions, and regions alike. Seaworthy Collective's bottom-up approach for holistic regional development is working to break down systemic barriers for ocean and climate impact, which enables leveraging the other 71% of our planet (the ocean) as an asset against climate change. Not only do we need to support the development of communities and solutions, but also think bigger by growing innovation ecosystems. Altogether, this bottom-up approach is key to unlocking the untapped talent and ideas that will drive the scale of regional innovation needed to collectively regenerate our blue planet.,Daniel Kleinman

This abstract provides an overview of the current state of climate change awareness in Africa, highlighting the challenges faced, the progress achieved, and the critical steps needed to address this pressuring issue.\nAfrica, with its diverse climates and vulnerabilities, is highly susceptible to the adverse effects of climate change. These effects manifest in the form of increased temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, more frequent and severe droughts, flooding, and extreme weather events. These climate-induced challenges have far-reaching consequences on food security, water resources, health, and livelihoods, disproportionately affecting vulnerable communities.\nAwareness of climate change in Africa has been growing, driven by a combination of scientific research, international agreements like the Paris Agreement, and the work of environmental organizations and activists. Governments, civil society, and grassroots initiatives have been instrumental in raising awareness and advocating for climate action.\nHowever, significant challenges persist. Limited access to information, education, and resources hampers efforts to address climate change effectively. Additionally, the urgency of climate action often competes with other pressing developmental priorities, making it challenging to allocate sufficient resources to mitigate and adapt to climate change. \nIn recent year, African countries have made substantial progress in climate change mitigation and adaptation. Many nations have developed National Adaptation Plans and have taken steps to integrate climate change considerations into their development agendas. \nRenewable energy projects are also on the rise, offering sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels. \nTo further advance climate change awareness and action in Africa, several key strategies should be prioritized: \n\nEducation and Awareness: Strengthening climate change education at all levels of society, from schools to communities, to empower individuals with knowledge and understanding.\nPolicy Integration: Ensuring that climate change considerations are fully integrated into national policies and development plans.\n\nInternational Cooperation: Collaborating with the global community to access funding, technology, and expertise to support climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts.\nCommunity Engagement: Involving local communities in climate action and decision-making processes to ensure sustainable, context-specific solutions.\n\nIn conclusion, climate change awareness in Africa is on the rise, but numerous challenges persist. Concerted efforts are needed to bridge information gaps, integrate climate considerations into policy and development, and ensure equitable access to resources and knowledge. With proactive measures and international collaboration, Africa can harness its potential to mitigate and adapt to climate change, safeguarding its people and ecosystems for generations to come.\n,Timothy Kwabla Zilevu

There is ample evidence to indicate that regenerating the local small Water Cycle significantly provides beneficial influence to the greater planetary Water Cycle. \n\nThe traditional Native Hawaiian model of the Moku Ahupua'a Watershed management system and the rainforest guardianship of the Amazon biosphere by the Indigenous Peoples is clear proof of concept that what is being proposed, adapted to each Watersheds' unique circumstances and to our modern times, is a simple system that will work well over the long run. The torching of Lahaina is a prime example of the dire consequences in following land use practices that DO NOT work, killing our precious children.\n\nWe already have every tool we will need, as well as a full quiver of expertise and viable solutions ready to engage for this movement. What we're missing is the comprehensive organizational design framework serving to bridge our vast inspiration for a world that works for All Life with the effective, efficient implementation of practical field projects getting the work done in the shortest amount of time.\n\nOn behalf of generations far into the future. we must ask ourselves, how do we organize our species in turning the tipping point towards abundant thriving life?\n\nTHIS is the most important conversation we could be having as we gather together during this Climate Week in NYC.,Elizabeth Herald

The only options available to them are so costly that they result in high rates of defaults and/or perpetual debt entrapment. This cyclical spiral results in a chronic lack of liquidity and underemployment, which severely constrain economic growth and human development in many regions around the world.  The estimated unmet demand for credit in these markets is 5.2T, which traditional finance has proven inadequate to address. Innovative financial models within the collaborative finance umbrella are better suited for tackling this problem because they don’t rely solely on external capital sources to bootstrap funding, and thus lower the cost of credit. I will share about our team’s contribution to collaborative finance, the stable credit protocol, which provides communities the tools they need to build a more self-reliant credit system and improve their local economy, while simultaneously gaining access to the global financial network.,Sayer Tindall
