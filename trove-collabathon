"description":"The goal of this project is to put together a database of resources related to social platform interoperability, and a process by which it can stay up to date and useful to the CTA. Topics of information covered by library would include:\\n- Existing standards and protocols that support and enable interoperability\\n- Research, standards, protocols, tools and ideas related to sovereign identity, data portability, data schemas, linked data, decentralized technologies, etc. \\n- Research, protocols and practices around effective group collaboration, cooperation and coordination. \\n- Valuable data ontologies and taxonomies\\n- Existing social platforms in the space that we should be paying attention to (this could be connected to the Nutrition Label proposal)\\n\\nThis would likely start with an Airtable database as the main backend, though also work considering a wiki alongside that. \\n",

"description":"Projects and people within the _CTA_ ecosystem lack a central place to _explore _other projects and people, and improve collaboration and coordination. Without a proper ecosystem map, projects will start up without knowing solutions already exist, and much t_ime and energy will be unnecessarily spent duplicating efforts. Energy and effort that could otherwise_ go toward creating impact. Although current directories like airtable exist, _keeping them up to date is challenging enough that it rarely happens_. _This information makes sense in limited contexts. Other contexts, like discovery, matchmaking, coordination and resource sharing need to be nurtured more actively and effectively_. _Alternative_ tools allow the same data to be presented to different audiences with their own specific use cases, which is why we plan to build this map in a way that is easily interoperable with other tools. Our confidence is based on our experience building a sync integration with Airtable and kumu. \\n",
