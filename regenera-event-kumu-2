Thanks to her grandmother who taught her the traditional songs of her ancestors, Snow Raven participated and performed in many of her people's summer solstice ceremonies or Yhyakh.\n\nShe was honored with the rare opportunity of meeting the 12th Sky Shaman Savey of the Tungus reindeer herders' tribe in her homeland.

The shifts happen in moments of awareness and insight. He emphasizes the difference between the common “deductive” form of learning and the uncommon  and unfamiliar “inductive” form of learning, more related to the arts, and that these two forms need to be co-related in the new form of education in the future.",

And we are inviting you to pay attention to it. \n\nThis simplicity comes from the ongoing, inherent, self-organizing process that exists at every scale of our universe and is capable of performing the most complex tasks with minimum effort. \n\nCurrently, most human beings have lost their synchronous connection with this process as a result of our development of a perception of illusive separation and the domination of our approximate, linear model we created through our self-awareness process. \n\nThough it has illusively separated us from the greater system, this self-awareness process was not a wasted effort as it is part of the greater self-awareness process of the planet Earth. Earth has come into self-awareness through our linear approximate modeling, and now we are emerging into a nonlinear digital era of transformation to reconnect with this inherent self-organizing process. \n\nWe are inviting humanity to come into conscious acknowledgment of this deep simplicity that exists within us and all around us so that we may resync with the greater process we are a part of, and actively participate as part of a whole that is greater the sum of its parts.",

"description":"Shortly after my 2 month Pacific crossing by sailboat with the Eat Less Plastic initiative I found myself  painting an underwater coral reef environment that allowed me to feel like I was diving underneath a Hammerhead shark gathering. I saved it to my sketch library and forgot about it. \nWhat I did not know back then is that I pre-conceived a design that would become the home to the Augmented and Virtual Reality Gallery of 2021s OceanDrop, an NFT auction of the OpenEarth Foundation in collaboration with NFT minting platform DoinGud.com featuring 20 internationally renown Artists. \n\nThe OVERgallery is virtually geo located in Alcyon, a world famous dive site discovered by Jacques Cousteau, located on Cocos Island, Costa Rica. This underwater gallery immerses you in the depths of the ocean, light beaming down, surrounding you in a marine world. Above you can see the famous hammerhead sharks of Alcyon peacefully gliding through the water. It features the work from Nicole Buffett, Frenetik Void, POSTWOOK, Paul Nicklen, Cristina Mittermeier, Rebecca Rose ft. Swaggy Wolfdog & Dj Swagrman, Trnvir Singh, MB Boissonnault, Will Selviz, Mieke Marple, Fractal Frontiers, Sara Ludy, Kyle Gordon, Popil, Gilles Augustijnen, Kevin Mack, Jens Kull, Isla Moon & Silvio Pupo, Kevin Heisner, OVR x Jens Kull, OEF x Martin Wainstien and OEF x Rudolph Goldenberg.\n\nMy guided experience will showcase this MetaNFT gallery with a walkthrough, how I conceived it and how serendipity was the key factor for bringing it to life.\nI am also going to emphasize on how Foundations and Artists can crosspollinate each other by collaborating radically. Donating part of earnings when minting NFTs on Doingud.com becomes a powerful tool and creates omni wins, empowering endeavors we personally care for.",

"description":"What's an NFTree, and how is it going to help plant 2 Trillion Trees? Discover how Virginia Castillo is catalyzing the most recent art and crypto craze, NFTs, as a tool to plant trees all over the world through her foundation Humans I Trust. Virginia was named one of Inc. Magazine's “Top 27 Women to Change the World” & “One of the top 16 Women in the NFT space” by Hackernoon. Come discover how Regenerative Finance can help solve Climate Change and vet involved! \n\nWhen observational film maker and activist Sky Owen Richards sat down with his friend and now co-director for a cerveza in Central Mexico, a passionate conversation on the philosophy of \"What Progress Is\" escalated to what would become a six month journey touring the jungle Selva de la Candona, the 2nd largest forrest on the continent, in order to track and film the real time impact of a 10 billion dollar mega project being called one of the most ambitious touristic and economic impact projects in the world; known as ‘The Mayan Train. What these two film makers learned is the true cost of which \"Progress\" arrives. Tren Maya is a feature film documentary that explores a high-speed train project that is threatening the last uncolonized region in Mexico, the culture and livelihood and the indigenous Mayan communities, and is said to expedite stripping the region completely bare of wildlife, trees and it's natural ecosystem in just 50 years. This film empowers the voice of the Mayan people through interviews in which you too will learn what will be lost at the cost of progress. There is still hope. The feature film \"Tren May\" ambitiously was created in only two years time to raise awareness and redirect the tracks of the high-speed train. Discover how you can help. \nJoin me and the Design Science Studio at this upcoming Regenera-Rising Vitual Summit to get a front row seat to this panel interview with Sky Owen Richards and discover what you can do to help secure and protect the largest rainforest in Central America and the indigenous Mayan people that call it home.",

Discover how Virginia Castillo is catalyzing the most recent art and crypto craze, NFTs, as a tool to plant trees all over the world through her foundation Humans I Trust. Virginia was named one of Inc. Magazine's “Top 27 Women to Change the World” & “One of the top 16 Women in the NFT space” by Hackernoon. Come discover how Regenerative Finance can help solve Climate Change and vet involved! \n\nWhen observational film maker and activist Sky Owen Richards sat down with his friend and now co-director for a cerveza in Central Mexico, a passionate conversation on the philosophy of \"What Progress Is\" escalated to what would become a six month journey touring the jungle Selva de la Candona, the 2nd largest forrest on the continent, in order to track and film the real time impact of a 10 billion dollar mega project being called one of the most ambitious touristic and economic impact projects in the world; known as ‘The Mayan Train. What these two film makers learned is the true cost of which \"Progress\" arrives. Tren Maya is a feature film documentary that explores a high-speed train project that is threatening the last uncolonized region in Mexico, the culture and livelihood and the indigenous Mayan communities, and is said to expedite stripping the region completely bare of wildlife, trees and it's natural ecosystem in just 50 years. This film empowers the voice of the Mayan people through interviews in which you too will learn what will be lost at the cost of progress. There is still hope. The feature film \"Tren May\" ambitiously was created in only two years time to raise awareness and redirect the tracks of the high-speed train. Discover how you can help. \nJoin me and the Design Science Studio at this upcoming Regenera-Rising Vitual Summit to get a front row seat to this panel interview with Sky Owen Richards and discover what you can do to help secure and protect the largest rainforest in Central America and the indigenous Mayan people that call it home.",

Which is why it can be so nerve wrecking to do so! Your soul is on display for all to hear and witness. In this 60 minute Voice Activation workshop designed for culture creators and visionary trailblazer. You will be guided into your body to access the home of the voice. You will empower your communication skills and self awareness with meditation, breathwork, vocal toning, eye gazing and simple singing exercises. You will also learn the basics of vibrational medicine and how to access your own source of regenerative energy.\n\nThis is the first workshop in a series and it requires no background in singing or singing talent, nor a desire to sing in any capacity beyond the meditative practices. \n\nHarmonize, created by Marly Benedicto, is a somatic wellness method that blends the spiritual singing rituals of Eastern India with practical and down-to-earth communication formulas developed from a decade in corporate business and team building. These practices refine your intuition and personal voice, while also clearing trauma and ancestrial ties that hold back your power of embodied expression so that you can ground your visions with clarity, confidence and collaboration.",

"description":"The main domains of Tarun Bharat Sangh have been water conservation, efficient use of water and water literacy. Over 40 years of working in the arid and semi-arid region of the country. TBS has helped more than 1,000 villages of 20 districts of Rajasthan and Maharashtra to build more than 12,000 rain water harvesting structures at strategic points impacting around 10,00,000 lives. TBS has helped successful community-based management and revival of 10 rivulets and their ecosystems making around one-million-hectare area from water-scarce to water surplus zone.  TBS did not only bring water security but major changes occurred in agriculture. Lands that earlier supported one crop started yielding two or three crops with good productivity and eventually doubled income-levels, food security, climate change adaptation and socio-economic status of the farmers. Today 75% of girls attend primary school as compared to the 5% earlier. The TBS’s model is time tested and has helped successful community-based management and revival of 10 rivers in the past and has been the backbone for river revival projects in Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka in India and Afghanistan, Iran and Myanmar, abroad. Local communities are directly involved in the decision making and construction process, instilling a sense of ownership and community pride.

We will give a short presentation on the role of AI in helping humanity better map out its dreams and aspirations. We will present text and images generated by the collective dreams of the Design Science Studio and use the experience to explore how these technologies can be used to advance pattern recognition in collective thought. We will spend time writing about our dreams for future realities and contextualizing them with great forward thinkers of the past and present. These dreams will then be fed into an AI called The Scenius Machine (a neural network AI training dataset) which will be used to generate text and visuals based on the collective’s dreams for the future. We will then workshop how an organization like this can grow.",

Grab your favorite art supplies and jump in for a figure study session with Alecia Sacred Heart that will take you on an adventure through timed photographed poses starting with one minute gestures, progressing into longer meditations on form!  \n\nFrom Alecia:\n\n\"Empowering self expression is critical to the evolution of our minds and actions.   I would go so far as to say that the human form in visual art is the most integral force to convey experience.  ARTIVISM today almost requires our proficiency with the human figure.\"\n\nThis figure study session is dedicated to the brilliant design of the human form and its integral role in visual arts.

These tools are integral into how we reformat public safety, create sustainable environments, and build care-centered communities. Consent for a Better World is a starting point for further exploration into these concepts and a great place to ask questions or to just get your brain thinking about how to practice in everyday life.  I guarantee there will be something for everyone at any level of consent based knowledge in this offering. Consent is a regenerative gift we can give to ourselves, our relationships, and ultimately, our planet. When we learn together we create a path to massive cultural shifts!",

With the popularization of shadow work and all things regarding our traumas and triggers, we have collectively turned away from our greatest strengths and inner lights to tend to this important work. In the world of astrology, we look to the stars to understand ourselves better, as above, so below. Many on this path are familiar with black moon Lilith and her characteristics within our individual personae, however, very few are familiar with the polar opposite, White Moon Selena. \n\nThis point is considered to be the guardian angel point of the birth chart. What does this have to do with regen·era rising? I'm so glad you asked!\n\nImagine if people were each empowered with the belief that no matter what, they were supported? Knowing that you have a guardian angel can give you more pronoia - the belief that the universe is conspiring to shower you with blessings. This outlook is very powerful! It creates a frequency within that helps to amplify the success of pure hearted projects.\n\nLike the placebo effect, our imaginations are powerful tools for healing and creation. \n\nLets celebrate the blessings in our birth charts, and utilize the help of our guardian angel aspects to create heaven on earth!\nLearn about White Moon selena, find her in your chart, add to a group padlet so we can connect beyond this event and build a catalogue of angelic huemans to continue creating with.",

"description":"For a brief moment in time, we will be entering the NOW Sphere (the Natural Order Weather Sphere) where we will experience an innovative, experimental, and imagined application of the ancient indigenous practice and concept of day-keeping. \n\nThe N.O.O.S. (Natural Order Operating System: the News of the Noosphere) will BEAMcast an interpretation of the Energy of the Day, in the form of a \"Time Weather\" Report. Harnessing the wisdom of Astro-Genetics and a recently invented Galactic Calendar deriving principles of Mayan origins, we will orient ourselves within the energetic themes of 4, 7, 13, and 28 day cycles of time.\n\nWith this newfound awareness of the highlighted energetic themes of the day, our consciousness will be primed and ready to recognize moments of synchronicity throughout the day, from our experiences, from one another, and the \"noosphere\", or our collective planetary mind. \n\nWhether we decide to savor the ensuing miraculous moments, or take practical action on the synchronistic messages we receive, we can ultimately celebrate the beauty of this current moment in time. \n\nAs we relax into allowing ourselves to be guided toward choosing positive choices, we can feel empowered to create ever-more-beautiful experiences for the benefit of us all!",

"description":"Gyrokinesis is a holistic movement exercise that addresses the entire body, as a multidimensional gyroscopic, breathing, organism. It brings a blend of dance, tai chi, yoga, into a flowing movement system, based on somatic awareness of the built-in architectural support of the body... engaging with this \"tensegrity\".  Gyrokinesis works toward opening energy pathways, stimulating the nervous system, increasing range of motion and creating functional strength through rhythmic, flowing movement sequences. \nIt is an original and unique method that takes you on an inner journey, which coordinates movement, breath and mental focus to stimulate the entire being. Majority of class will take place seated on a chair, with some space for potential floor work and integrating the body with standing.",

We are called forward now toward a culture of care and inclusivity, we are all architects of the future, and the first landscape we are called to design is our internal one. \n\nThe artifacts we create, including buildings, towns, and cities, are projections of the consciousness used to make them. We can cultivate the renewable resources of mindfulness, compassion, and awareness to build structures within ourselves which create more presence, empathy, and peace in the world around us. Even though everything is energy and connected through the field of consciousness, we can’t simply escape into our inner world and forget the external one. This experience will culminate in the exploration of principles from sacred architecture, permaculture, and geodesign and their applications in building truly regenerative communities which become tools for culture creation at a massive scale.",

"description":"(New Project Title:\nDeep Design // HOMEdash\n\n(New Overview Description)\nHow can we build a world that works for all from the inside out? What kinds of systems can catalyze regenerative living at a global scale? Deep Design explores the invisible architecture of our inner spaces and how this informs the way we design our outer spaces and visible architecture. The artist bridges individual and collective experiences of unity through this work, including still images and a virtual globe. Approach the video to enter a portal and open the link to explore the prototype for HOMEdash, a dashboard which visualizes the heartbeat of Mother Earth using real data. \n\n(Lion) \nApproach this representation of divine life force energy with reverence, invite your soul to find rest as you contemplate the infinite source of all creation. Connect with the invisible energetic source of all life through the archetypal symbolism depicted here as a reflection of what is sacred within you.\n\n(Goddess)\nThe Initiatrix has a challenge for you, will you accept this initiation? Can you walk as love in a world so full of fear? Are you willing to take up the sword of truth and stand for justice? Allow yourself to connect with a source of power and strength within yourself which comes from a realm beyond space and time.\n\n(Rose)\nEnter the inner temple where the white light from above meets with the red light from below in sacred union. The white spiral is a symbol of virginity, the kind which cannot be lost or tarnished, it represents the maiden, an archetype which speaks to the primordial purity within all beings. Rest in the soft innocence of your eternal soul.\n\n(Video) \nHOMEdash is a gamified dashboard for visualizing the heartbeat of Mother Earth based on real data. It is a system which empowers community efforts worldwide and supports participation in building regenerative environments. This is a prototype of a unified planetary operating system which optimizes livingry and resources to serve 100% of all life, helping humanity keep planetary boundaries in check and achieve sustainable development by 2030.",

In the Fall of 2017, an initiative was filed with the Attorney General at the California State Capitol to put the Rights of Nature into the US Constitution. It was drafted by Clare Hedin who created it as a collaborative, living, document to be available for use throughout the global territories. It was reviewed and contributed to by Nature's Rights, Tree Sisters, CELDF, Right To Amend, Polly Higgins (Eradicating Ecocide), and others. At its heart it restores two main rights: A) The rights of human beings to have access to clean, healthy, regenerative nature, to have a say in their local environment’s development and stewarding, and, B) The rights of all living beings, including wildlands, seas, oceans, and air to have the right to their own healthy experience of themselves with the dignity that all life behests upon each living being and each natural system. This document is ready and waiting to be applied anywhere and everywhere to protect the work being done by environmental and civil rights groups around the world, seeking justice and equal access to healthy and safe living systems.",
