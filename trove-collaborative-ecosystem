"description":"Seriously App \\nOnline User Manual by Jonathan Sand\\n\\nThinking is hard for most of us. Our conscious thinking memory is limited. We forget important bits, get distracted by emotions, logic, and details. Mind map tools are promising, but I want more … a tool I can live inside:\\n\\nCompletely empty your mind to a place you can review it & keep it organized\\n\\nFocus on a tiny set of related thoughts … like writing on a piece of paper\\n\\nEverything should be easy, the tool should work hard for you\\n\\nDo a lot using just the keyboard: add & edit, move ideas around, collapse & expand, search, establish or change focus\\n\\nKeep track of a lot, yet help you not feel lost or overwhelmed\\n\\nCompact easy-to-organize list of current favorites\\n\\nExtra features that come in handy: color, grouping, lines with titles, some preferences\\n\\nDo all this from your mac (and eventually iPhone and iPad), no fussing\\n",

While mainstream economics has resulted in a rich body of mathematical theory and public policy practice over a long history, over the years several fault lines and limitations have also surfaced which are now being addressed by novel interdisciplinary approaches such as complexity theory, behavioral economics, econophysics, quantum decision theory, etc.",

"description":"Inspired by Octavia Butler's explorations of our human relationship to change, Emergent Strategy is radical self-help, society-help, and planet-help designed to shape the futures we want to live. Change is constant. The world is in a continual state of flux. It is a stream of ever-mutating, emergent patterns. Rather than steel ourselves against such change, this book invites us to feel, map, assess, and learn from the swirling patterns around us in order to better understand and influence them as they happen. This is a resolutely materialist “spirituality” based equally on science and science fiction, a visionary incantation to transform that which ultimately transforms us.",

"description":"An investment, learning, and market development initiative bringing together leading impact investors to encourage greater impact and use of catalytic capital\\n\\nCatalytic capital—investment capital that is patient, risk-tolerant, concessionary, and flexible—is an essential tool to support impact-driven enterprises and organizations that lack access to capital on suitable terms through the conventional marketplace. The aim of catalytic capital is to unlock impact and additional investment that would not otherwise be possible, strengthening communities, expanding opportunity and economic growth, and fueling innovation that advances the well-being of people and the planet, while laying the groundwork for mainstream investors to participate in transformative investments.\\n\\nTo make substantial progress toward a more just, inclusive, and resilient world, we need more catalytic capital to flow. The Catalytic Capital Consortium, or C3, aims to demonstrate the power of this form of investment to extend and deepen the reach of the impact investing field, helping to address the annual funding shortfall of $2.5 trillion in developing countries alone that is hindering the world from reaching the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The initiative is helping a select group of outstanding, diverse funds address some of the world’s most pressing challenges, while also building knowledge, awareness, and use of catalytic capital globally.",

"description":"I believe that our civilization has reached a state of negativity, hostility, and exhaustion for too many. I feel that wonderfully typical desire to so something about it.\\n\\nTrust in others is rare, skepticism is vigorous, we expect to be deceived, betrayed, and bombarded with falsehoods. Our online existence is filled with complexities, passwords, and the constant threat of predators. Junk mail, ads, disinformation, and fear mongering consume our attention. Software adds more misery with unwanted calls, scams, and frustrating help. We have normalized to a culture of junk, violence, riots, manipulation, and neglect.\\n\\nThis is an absurd way for our species to treat itself. Very few other species behave in such a manner. We are intelligent beings who have accomplished much for ourselves.\\n\\nLet's declare that this is a problem we will solve: Create a thriving world that prioritizes the long-term well-being of all of us, not just a few. We set aside the stories that tell us it's impossible. Our lives filled with meaning, passion, and self-expression. Civilization 2.0 is my name for it. 1.0 got us here, bringing huge storehouses of knowledge. Let's pour it into revising the way we relate to each other. Hippies merge with high powered philosophy and neuroscience. Slow and steady. Declaring that we will pull it off.",

How can we discover the synergies more quickly?\"  In essence, people want to share their expertise and their projects, people need to see the whole community more clearly to be able to choose where they fit,  and we all need to speed this up to use resources more wisely and scale the great work that is already happening. \\n\\nExisting solutions are often maps that are curated by only a few people and cannot be edited by all members and so quickly become high-maintenance or fall out-of-date.
