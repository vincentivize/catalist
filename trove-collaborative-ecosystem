"description":"Seriously App \nOnline User Manual by Jonathan Sand\n\nThinking is hard for most of us. Our conscious thinking memory is limited. We forget important bits, get distracted by emotions, logic, and details. Mind map tools are promising, but I want more … a tool I can live inside:\n\nCompletely empty your mind to a place you can review it & keep it organized\n\nFocus on a tiny set of related thoughts … like writing on a piece of paper\n\nEverything should be easy, the tool should work hard for you\n\nDo a lot using just the keyboard: add & edit, move ideas around, collapse & expand, search, establish or change focus\n\nKeep track of a lot, yet help you not feel lost or overwhelmed\n\nCompact easy-to-organize list of current favorites\n\nExtra features that come in handy: color, grouping, lines with titles, some preferences\n\nDo all this from your mac (and eventually iPhone and iPad), no fussing\n",

Change is constant. The world is in a continual state of flux. It is a stream of ever-mutating, emergent patterns. Rather than steel ourselves against such change, this book invites us to feel, map, assess, and learn from the swirling patterns around us in order to better understand and influence them as they happen. This is a resolutely materialist “spirituality” based equally on science and science fiction, a visionary incantation to transform that which ultimately transforms us.",
