The Mutuality Platform is a tool that can be used by most communities to showcase and track local efforts, promoting the new social change field of \"peer-driven change\". It is a safe eco-system of residents and supporters who are willing to share and assist one another towards improving their lives and communities.  This platform allows like-minded residents and communities to connect within a region or across continents in support of one another.  It also allows supporters to donate/invest in resident-led efforts.  ",
