"description":"This discussion with Charles Martens will introduce the plasma technology that enables a more interconnected, net-zero hydrocarbon economy. Martens is the Founder and President of LTEOIL, a game-changing energy transition technology company. At their Texas A&M laboratory, LTEOIL is focused on leading the development of plasma-based techniques for hydrocarbon processing. The patented non-thermal reaction uses low pressure and low heat to crack and reform the carbon molecules combining non-equilibrium plasma and electro-physics. LTEOIL offers unprecedented technological improvement to the efficiency of energy production. Martens, the scientists and LTEOIL team members have bootstrapped the plasma technology, producing fundamental science without being under the influence of the oil giants. They have laid the path for hydrocarbon production without emissions.",

"description":"The main domains of Tarun Bharat Sangh have been water conservation, efficient use of water and water literacy. Over 40 years of working in the arid and semi-arid region of the country. TBS has helped more than 1,000 villages of 20 districts of Rajasthan and Maharashtra to build more than 12,000 rain water harvesting structures at strategic points impacting around 10,00,000 lives. TBS has helped successful community-based management and revival of 10 rivulets and their ecosystems making around one-million-hectare area from water-scarce to water surplus zone.  TBS did not only bring water security but major changes occurred in agriculture. Lands that earlier supported one crop started yielding two or three crops with good productivity and eventually doubled income-levels, food security, climate change adaptation and socio-economic status of the farmers. Today 75% of girls attend primary school as compared to the 5% earlier. The TBS’s model is time tested and has helped successful community-based management and revival of 10 rivers in the past and has been the backbone for river revival projects in Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka in India and Afghanistan, Iran and Myanmar, abroad. Local communities are directly involved in the decision making and construction process, instilling a sense of ownership and community pride. It also enables them to replicate it again elsewhere and carry out any necessary maintenance.",

"description":"What is our story? Traditional religion had an answer. So did modernity. But if these narratives are no longer able to effectively cope with the complex world we are entering, what do we do? As it happens, there is a new, holistic story that has emerged from the cutting edge of science that may help us integrate the insights of the past with the call of the future. As of yet, this story remains largely trapped in textbooks and lecture halls. What if it could be unleashed, through the poetic imagination, in vibrant symbols and new myths? Could it orient a regenerative era towards a new way of being? What is the story that begs to be told?",

This concept uses methods that harness desirable aspects of the climate, while repelling those that are inhospitable. Whether in urban or sparsely populated settings, customized micro-climates will allow for people to thrive more comfortably and independently. This off-grid living approach affords for greater resident awareness as it supports a symbiotic relationship between nature and humans. Ultimately, this design is for people who want to experience a higher level of freedom and efficiency. The development of this educational facility will test this theory through ethically embedded softwares within the built structure.",

And in the mental and physical health crises, people are increasingly unable to work. And there is a massive new self-care industry and all sorts of new specialized tech industries..\nWe have exponentially multiplying possibilities, but live in a finite world, which means that people capable of bringing forth stuff of value, actions adequate to the crises, systems capable of overcoming problems, will be the greatest scarcity going forward and will therefore become the hottest commodity.\nThose who can need to build themselves into businesses that are successful in the existing system and then use the incredible power that that will grant them to act as umbrella patrons for communities that spring up at their feet and those communities and the alternative models that they are structured around will just grow and reabsorb the assets of the old institutions as they crumble \nand so we look to the stars to see our reflections as part of a evolving, successing, healing ecosystem\nand allow all our illusions to dissolve\nand act with compassion\nand we will grow like trees\nand the water will flow\nand the forest return",
