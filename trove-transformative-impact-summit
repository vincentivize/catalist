"description":"I’m Alejandro, the Founder of Kokonut Network.\\n\\nMy story initiated at 15 yrs old when I was still in high school. I learned about VoIP technology, and I was just a teenager full of dreams looking for ways to make money without a diploma. One year later, I had almost 50 call centers as customers and multiple independent sellers working under me. Can you imagine a 16-year-old schoolboy in 2005-2006 making this kind of income?! By just using a phone and sometimes the school computer lab. I remember my teachers were bothered by how much time I wanted to spend in the lab to service my customers. VoIP business in my country started to fade due to local regulations, and I moved on to other things.\\n\\nI then decided to get into website development with one of my oldest friends, whom I met at college in 2008. I started developing websites as a freelancer to gain experience in everything internet related until 2014 when I became an eBay Power Seller.\\n\\nOver the years, I had many opportunities to work in different areas, plus my passion was the internet. Today I run a tech company with two of my oldest friends, which is how Kokonut Network came to life.\\n\\nKokonut Network is our company's first project, so we started this journey with a big hit, and we have grand plans for the agriculture sector in the Dominican Republic. Our soil and weather are perfect for growing different vegetables and fruits.",
