"description":"We’re bringing the Bubble community together in New York City for an evening of inspiration, connection, and fun. Join us to see what fellow builders are creating with Bubble, including live demos of native mobile apps built by our users. You’ll also hear from Kathleen Gao, a Senior Software Engineer on Mobile, as she shares helpful tips for Bubble Developers and explores the key differences between building for mobile and web on Bubble. Enjoy pizza and drinks while you meet fellow Bubblers, share ideas, and build new connections. Members of the Bubble team will be on hand to answer questions and hear about what you’re building. Space is limited, so RSVP soon to secure your spot. If you’re an NYC-based user building a native mobile app on Bubble, we’d love to spotlight you at the event — email by Friday, August 8 to be considered. We can’t wait to see you there!  **Details:**  Bubble HQ  22 W 21st St, Fl 2, New York, NY 10010  Tuesday, August 19 | 6–8 PM ET",

"description":"## Introduction\nNetwork graphs are a way of representing connections or relationships between objects. In a network chart, objects are represented as points or “nodes” and connections between objects are represented as links. Also known as **node-link diagrams**, network charts are ideal for visualizing social networks, corporate structures or any other network of relationships.\n\n## Anatomy of a network graph\nA network chart typically consists of a few elements: **nodes** or points that represent the objects being connected, as well as **links** that represent the relationships between the nodes. It is common to size the points according to **a numerical value**, and they can also be supplemented with an image.\n\nUsing the Flourish’s free [Network Graph template](https://app.flourish.studio/templates#template-network-graph), you can add **directional arrows** on the links to indicate the direction of the connection. This can be useful for understanding the flow of data or communication between nodes.\n\n## Data structure\nTo create a Flourish network graph, you need to organize your data into **two separate sheets**. One sheet should list all the points you want to visualize, along with their relevant information. The second sheet should define the connections or links between those points.\n\n### Points sheet\nYou need one column that will serve as a unique identifier for each point in the network. If you’d like to have points of different size, you also need a **numerical column** to size by. You also have the option to add additional information, such as a category to color by or images.\n\n### Links sheet\nOnce you’ve defined all points you need visualized, you can then connect them in the Links sheet. You need **two columns** – one for the source point and another one for the target point. If you wish, you can add a third column to assign a numerical value for the **thickness of the links**. This allows you to highlight the strength or importance of the connections, providing additional information and emphasis in your network graph.\n\n## Resources\nHere are some resources to help you get started with network graphs:\n- [Network Graph – an overview](https://help.flourish.studio/article/51-network-graph-an-overview)\n- [How to make your labels show in all states](https://help.flourish.studio/article/54-how-to-make-your-labels-show-in-all-states)\n- [How to create a Flourish story](https://help.flourish.studio/article/13-creating-a-story)\n- [Six practical ways to leverage AI for data visualization](https://flourish.studio/blog/ai-for-better-charts/)",
