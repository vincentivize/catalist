"description":"**Charles Eisenstein** is an American public speaker and [author](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author). His work covers a wide range of topics, including the [history of human civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_history), [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics), [spirituality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality), and the [ecology movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology_movement). Key themes explored include [anti-consumerism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-consumerism), [interdependence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdependence), and how [myth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth) and [narrative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative) influence culture. According to Eisenstein, global culture is immersed in a destructive \"story of separation\", and one of the main goals of his work is to present an alternative \"story of interbeing\". Much of his work draws on ideas from [Eastern philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_philosophy) and the spiritual teachings of various [indigenous peoples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples). Eisenstein has been involved in the [Occupy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Movement), [New Economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Economy_Movement_in_the_United_States), and [permaculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture) movements.\\n",

"description":"Our Why\\nWhether issues of climate, food systems, or displacement, we see more and more time, attention, and resources spent searching for solutions to the worlds hardest problems. \\n\\nBut what if the solutions are already here? We believe the answers are in our communities and all around us: they’re simply disconnected from the resources they need (and from one another.) \\n\\nOur What\\nWe believe that when equipped with our greatest resource of all—one another—each and every one of us is capable of supporting our capacity to thrive. So we’re weaving a multi-sided ecosystem that empowers us all, where we are, with what we have, to be the greatest lever for change. \\n\\nWe innovate social, technical, and financial tools that support our ability to collectively innovate on, resource, and apply solutions to the world’s most pressing issues. \\n\\nOur first tool is Open Impact, a platform that coordinates and connects on-the-ground efforts, transparently measures their progress, and matches them with the resources they need to scale—whether it’s capital, skills, or knowledge. We’re currently modeling and refining with 170 organizations in 16 countries. \\n\\nWe believe that true resilience scales many-to-many, and that we each have a unique part to play in this movement-of-movements. We see everything we do as an example and an opportunity for learning, and strive to hold contexts for radical humility: giving us the freedom to design not for the answers we think we know, but for the processes of evolving together when we try, fail, and learn the first, second, and hundredth time. We also believe deeply in collective and long-term stewardship, and strive to align our systems of decisionmaking and reciprocity with a thriving world for future generations.\\n\\nWe strive to support the local exchange of resources, and the global exchange of knowledge, and we thank you for being a part of that exchange with us. You can learn more about our ethics and organizing principles below. \\n",

De schaalgrootte die nodig was in een industriële samenleving met massaproductie is steeds minder relevant, en daarmee ook de landelijke inrichting van de samenleving. De fundamenten van onze samenleving dienen opnieuw te worden opgebouwd.

At the heart of the Blue Marble perspective you’ll find a pattern of breaking down silos, integrating separated functions, connecting people and places, and creating linkages across time.\\n\\nIn that spirit, Blue Marble evaluation focuses on integrating design, engagement, implementation, and evaluation of programs and interventions of all kinds, especially initiatives working on making global systems more equitable and sustainable.\\n\\nWhat it's not\\nBlue Marble Evaluation is not a specific set of methods or measurements, though treating the global system as the focus of evaluation has major methodological and measurement implications.

Kitepower’s patented technology is a game-changer in the wind energy sector: Kitepower uses up to 90% less material with the potential of being twice as efficient than conventional wind turbines with the same power output. Unlike conventional wind turbines, Kitepower systems do not require resource-intensive towers nor heavy foundations and are thus highly mobile and easy to deploy. The system is able to harness stronger and more persistent winds at higher altitudes, allowing for capacity factors greater than 0.5 and cost-effective electricity generation in return.

A Machinery Ring matches a shortage of machinery and labour capacity on one farm with a surplus on another. We use the collective buying power to source all farm inputs from fuel to concrete (or anything else) at better prices than individual Member businesses can. All Agri-Businesses are eligible to join and each pays an annual subscription in order to access the services.\\nScotland’s first Machinery Ring was established in 1987. Now the Scottish Machinery Ring Association has member Rings throughout Scotland, serving more than 7000 farmers and other rural businesses.\\n",

Programmatic work at the intersection of local actions and theory on root causes is often the missing piece in efforts to establish an ecological civilization that serves the wellbeing of people and the planet.\\n\\nEcoCiv aggregates and amplifies existing solutions or actions, connecting dots between siloed issues and breaking down barriers in order to catalyze action. Specifically, EcoCiv supports local partners in the process of designing and implementing more effective and efficient solutions in particular locations (“hubs”), and then aims to prompt the replication and scaling of those solutions in other locations.

"description":"The Next Stage of Development for Human Coexistence\\nImagine a system in which a private company as a “government service provider” offers you protection of life, liberty and property. This service would include internal and external security, a legal and regulatory framework, and independent dispute resolution. You would pay a contractually fixed amount per year for these services. Besides that, you would take care of everything yourself. You would be able to do as you please, limited only by the rights of others and the contractually agreed rules of coexistence.\\n\\nThe government service provider as the operator of the community cannot unilaterally change this “Citizen Contract” with you at a later date. Disputes between you and the government service provider would be heard before independent arbitration tribunals, as is customary in international commercial law. If the operator ignores arbitral awards or abuses their power, their customers would leave and they would go bankrupt. The operator therefore has to face the economic consequences of their actions, giving them an incentive to treat their customers well in accordance with their contract.\\n\\nOur mission is to support innovation in governance that leads to greater human freedom and prosperity.\\nWe aim to inspire, inform and connect people to accelerate the creation of a global market of living together in Free Cities.\\n\\nConsulting\\nFor those launching their own Free-Cities related projects, we can put you in contact with experts from the industry, offering consulting and advice.\\n",

We rent excursion locations throughout Europe and when the opportunity arises beyond that, where children from different countries come together. We are a growing school and our new form of education fits in seamlessly with parents who travel (income dependent) and want to be able to move and connect freely.\\n\\nA foreign school\\nWe are a foreign school, so not a Dutch school abroad, but a foreign school. \\nOur school is located outside the borders of the Netherlands and the school inspection does not extend beyond the borders of the Netherlands.

Drawing on libertarian socialist ideas and real-world examples throughout history, their motivation was to inspire hope, inform strategy and to demonstrate that a viable and better alternative to the two dominant economic systems of the last century, capitalism and a command economy, is possible.\\n\\nBefore designing new institutions, first we need to be clear what values a desirable economy should be based on. The key values of a participatory economy are defined as:\\n\\nSelf-Management\\n= For every individual to have a say in a decision based on the degree that they are affected by it.\\n\\nMore\\nJustice\\n= To fairly share burdens and benefits so that any differences in income from work are based on differences in effort or sacrifice.\\n\\nMore\\nSolidarity\\n= To foster an awareness of shared interests, togetherness and concern for the well-being of others.\\n\\nMore\\nEnvironmental Sustainability\\n= To nurture our natural environment and protect it for future generations through conservation and sustainable practices.\\n\\nMore\\nEfficiency\\n= To use our scarce resources and human talents wherever they return the greatest increase in human well-being.\\n\\nMore\\nDiversity\\n= To recognise that each individual is unique and to create a large variety of options for people to fulfill their lives\\n",

It redefines the concept of urban development and what cities of the future should look like.\\n\\nNo roads, cars or emissions, it will run on 100% renewable energy and 95% of land will be preserved for nature. People's health and wellbeing will be prioritized over transportation and infrastructure, unlike traditional cities. Only 200 meters wide, but 170 kilometers long and 500 meters above sea level.\\n\\nTHE LINE will eventually accommodate 9 million people and will be built on a footprint of just 34 square kilometers. This will mean a reduced infrastructure footprint, creating never-before-seen efficiencies in city functions. The ideal climate all-year-round will ensure that residents can enjoy the surrounding nature. Residents will also have access to all facilities within a five-minute walk, in addition to high-speed rail – with an end-to-end transit of 20 minutes.",
