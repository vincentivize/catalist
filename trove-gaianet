"description":"Kitepower is a leading start-up in Airborne Wind Energy (AWE), developing innovative and cost-effective alternatives to existing wind turbines. Kitepower’s patented technology is a game-changer in the wind energy sector: Kitepower uses up to 90% less material with the potential of being twice as efficient than conventional wind turbines with the same power output. Unlike conventional wind turbines, Kitepower systems do not require resource-intensive towers nor heavy foundations and are thus highly mobile and easy to deploy. The system is able to harness stronger and more persistent winds at higher altitudes, allowing for capacity factors greater than 0.5 and cost-effective electricity generation in return. Kitepower’s leading product, the [Kitepower Falcon](https://thekitepower.com/product/), is specially designed to allow remote communities worldwide to mitigate dependency on polluting and expensive diesel supply.\\n",

In particular, the Institute looks at ways to deepen participation beyond elections and to substantially increase the number of people meaningfully involved in political decision-making. The Solonian Democracy Institute also investigates inter-disciplinary issues that have a bearing on democracy, such as economic equality.\\n\\nThe Institute takes its name from Solon, the statesman who ushered in reforms that created the foundations for the development of democracy in ancient Athens. Solon is also credited with uttering many wise sayings, among them our slogan:\\n\\nJustice, even if slow, is sure.\\n\\nThe Institute has a strong focus on the history of alternative democratic practice. What differentiates the Institute is our understanding of the term democracy which is derived from the ancient Greek word demokratia, itself composed of the words demos and kratos – people power.\\nPutting political power in the hands of the people is at the centre of everything we do.\\n",

He called it ‘the biggest evolution of consciousness humanity has ever experienced’.\\n\\n“You are witnessing the dissolving of old systems and the birth of new energy consciousness.

"description":"### **Center For Applied Cultural Transition**\\nAt Brave Earth we are in an inquiry about how to adapt, create more resiliency and become more attuned to the current cultural context. This context is referred to as the Anthropocene, late-stage capitalism or the Kali Yuga.  \\nRegardless of the description, to be a contributing force for cultural evolution we will need to embody new and ancient ways of being. This requires great acts of courage as we shed our old belief systems and programming.\\nAs a living laboratory we are holding the questions of how do we decolonize our minds from the dominant culture of capitalism, patriarchy, racialized hierarchies, scarcity logic and oppressive systems of control? How do we become stewards in service to all Life? \\n",
