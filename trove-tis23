One idea is a panel with Anna Stone from GoodDollar to discuss our Community Solar + UBI pilot for 50 women in Uganda in partnership with Ayowecca Uganda. Possible panel title: \"Novel blockchain projects to increase economic opportunity, enhance climate resilience & advance gender equity in sub-Saharan Africa.\" We could also include other people with innovative projects in Africa like Simon Sallstrom with DirectEd Dev and I bet we could find another panelist. If you'd like, I can also give a presentation on The Solar Foundation that might be titled something like: \"Decentralized, off-grid solar is a public good. How The Solar Foundation harnesses the power of the sun and the power of the blockchain for meaningful, sustainable climate action in Africa.\" We are working on another pilot to measure our solar impact with a monitoring device from Switch (a Nigerian org) for retroactive funding and then also impact certificates for the qualitative impacts such as access to job skills, education, safety and security, climate resilience etc. - benefits that even small-scale solar solutions for the unpowered can enable.","Description":"I think I covered this above, but basically 3 areas that might be interesting to the Transformative Impact Summit attendees:\n1. Small solar delivers big impacts in SSA. With 600 million people lacking access to electricity in Africa, accelerating access to off-grid solar is essential to climate action & ensuring no one is left behind in the transition to clean energy.\n2. By collaborating with local nonprofits in Uganda, Nigeria and very soon, Tanzania, we are leveraging the power of blockchain to fund and accelerate real-life impact on the quality of people's lives, on addressing climate change and on working towards SDG #7 & SDG 13: Achieving universal (and clean!) energy access by 2030.\n3. Business as usual won't sufficiently address our global challenges such as climate crisis, gender inequity and financial exclusion. At The Solar Foundation, we aim to reinvent the nonprofit and NGO model using the tools of web3 and the power of DeFi to create open-source, novel funding mechanisms. A collaborative approach is essential to our mission and we are currently collaborating with GoodDollar on a community solar + UBI pilot in Uganda, and working on a retroactive funding pilot with Switch in Nigeria, and we seek to coordinate with diverse partners who share our desire to accelerate universal access to clean energy and provide an ownership stake in the solar deployed.

"description":"The Solar Foundation’s mission is to accelerate access to off-grid solar energy for underserved communities in emerging markets. We harness the power of the sun and the power of the blockchain to deliver real-world impact by providing reliable and affordable access to clean electricity while reducing CO2e and increasing climate resilience.\n\nWe believe decentralized, clean energy is a public good, and we’ve witnessed how small solar solutions unlock tangible benefits including community agency, self-sufficiency and climate resilience. We work to ensure that no one is left behind in the transition to renewables, especially climate-vulnerable people in rural sub-Saharan Africa—people experiencing increasingly severe climate effects while contributing the least to the climate crisis.\n\nThe Solar Foundation has completed off-grid solar projects in Uganda, Nigeria and Puerto Rico (please see the Solar Foundation website for details and pictures). We are currently working on a microgrid project for a school in Tanzania, planning a novel community solar + UBI pilot project with GoodDollar and an impact certs project with Switch to monitor our solar data for retroactive funding",

Here are my ideas: 1. Panel: Innovative blockchain projects for high impact in Sub-Saharan Africa.\" a panel with Anna Stone from GoodDollar (we are collaborating on a mobile tech + solar + UBI project to empower women & close the gender digital divide in Uganda) and also Simon Sallstrom from DirectEd Dev that's funding tech scholarships and bootcamps for students in Africa) and I'm sure we could find others!; 2. I could give a presentation entitled:\"Decentralized Solar is a Public Good. How The Solar Foundation harnesses the power of the sun + the power of blockchain to accelerate off-grid solar for underserved communities in Africa.\" or if this is too much blockchain, it could be: \"The Solar Foundation: Utilizing Collaboration & Innovation to Accelerate Solar Solutions in Underserved Communities in Africa.\"","Description":"3 areas that might be interesting to the Transformative Impact Summit attendees:\n1. Small solar delivers big impacts in SSA. With approx. 600 million people lacking access to electricity in Africa, accelerating access to off-grid solar is essential to climate action, social justice & ensuring no one is left behind in the transition to clean energy.\n2. By collaborating with local nonprofits in Uganda, Nigeria and very soon, Tanzania, we are leveraging the power of blockchain to fund and accelerate real-life impact on the quality of people's lives, on addressing climate change and on working towards SDG #7 & SDG 13: Achieving universal (and clean!) energy access by 2030.\n3. Business as usual won't sufficiently address our global challenges such as climate crisis, gender inequity and financial exclusion. At The Solar Foundation, we aim to reinvent the nonprofit and NGO model using the tools of web3 and the power of DeFi to create regenerative, open-source, novel funding mechanisms. A collaborative approach is essential to our mission and we are currently collaborating with GoodDollar on a community solar + UBI pilot in Uganda, working on a retroactive funding pilot with Switch in Nigeria, and we seek to coordinate with diverse partners who share our desire to accelerate universal access to clean energy and provide an ownership stake in the solar deployed.","Attendee Location":"In-Person",

We need to pivot to a new paradigm in order to fulfill our potential, meaning we have to collaborate more, overcome duplications, fill gaps, invest in innovation, leverage funding in different ways, and focus on a holistic approach if we are going to truly achieve the SDGs.","Bio":"The AB InBev Foundation is an innovative organization working to create a new model for corporate philanthropy by strategically identifying the spaces where catalytic funding can fill gaps and create a holistic impact that helps the world achieve the SDGs in a locally sustainable way. We do this by investing in innovative approaches to solve to the most neglected problems the world faces, while empowering changemakers with the resources they need to test new ideas and identify efficient, effective, scalable, and sustainable solutions.

Possible panel title: \"Novel blockchain projects to increase economic opportunity, enhance climate resilience & advance gender equity in sub-Saharan Africa.\" We could also include other people with innovative projects in Africa like Simon Sallstrom with DirectEd Dev and I bet we could find another panelist. \n\nI can also give a presentation on The Solar Foundation that might be titled something like: \"Decentralized, off-grid solar is a public good. How The Solar Foundation harnesses the power of the sun and the power of the blockchain for meaningful, sustainable climate action in Africa.\" With 600 million people in Africa lacking access to electricity — on one of the sunniest continents on Earth — it's clear that to meet SDG #7 by 2030, we need to accelerate access to solar power especially for those who live in rural, sub-Saharan Africa where even small, off-grid solar solutions can have transformational impact. Blockchain can be a mechanism to help build global coordination with local partners, transparently fund and monitor solar solutions and pilot new, Open Source models to help scale these efforts.\n\nIn addition, I can mention that we are working on a pilot to measure our solar impact with a monitoring device from Switch (a Nigerian org) for retroactive funding as well as experimenting with impact certificates. Clean energy is not an end in itself, it has a profound impact on people's quality of life and we are experimenting with impact certificates to illustrate qualitative solar impacts e.g., improved health, security, economic empowerment, access to education and the ability to respond to climate change.","Attendee Location":"In-Person","Speaker Status":"Applied",

By launching a charity working to build a world in which any person can realise their full potential, regardless of their draw in the lottery of life. \n\nBut the charitable sector is riddled with issues. Though most have the best of intentions, they often fall short in many respects: *transparency*, *cost-efficiency* and creating *sustainable impact* through **self-sufficiency**. \n\n### About Us\n\nDirectEd Development Foundation (DirectEd) is an international charitable not-for-profit organisation on a mission to deliver highly scalable training and paid internships in programming, soft skills and entrepreneurship to *high-potential under-resourced* students across Africa, starting in Kenya and Ethiopia.\n\nOur programme aims to prepare students between high school and university for a career as remote software engineers working for Western tech startups. \n\nThis will help us catalyse individual empowerment, knowledge transfer and economic development, fostering the next generation of African tech leadership.\n\n### **What Really Sets Us Apart**\n\nWe are pioneering the use of *stablecoins*, *smart contracts* and *decentralised identifiers* to facilitate milestone-based peer-to-peer scholarships because we believe that the combination of these technologies enables meaningful **transparency**, **traceability** and **accountability** at scale.\n\nDonors learn their impact in the short run through our Student’s Progress dashboard, and in the long run, through rigorous impact reports based on randomised control trial data.\n\n## **Our Vision**\n\nBy 2025, we envision that our programme has raised the lifetime earnings of our beneficiaries by $10 million, and their local communities by even more. Working with world-leading academic researchers, we seek to undertake rigorous empirical evaluations of our programme. Through our close partnerships with more than 30 schools and institutions across Kenya and Ethiopia, we will have had introduced programming to more than 5,000 students, trained 1000 to become software engineers and placed 200 students with western software companies or helped them launch their own start-ups.","Description":"What big problem does blockchain solve?

"description":"Title: Climate Change Awareness in Africa: Challenges, Progress, and the Path Forward\nAbstract: Climate change poses a significant and immediate threat to the African continent, impacting ecosystems, economies, and the well-being of its people. This abstract provides an overview of the current state of climate change awareness in Africa, highlighting the challenges faced, the progress achieved, and the critical steps needed to address this pressuring issue.\nAfrica, with its diverse climates and vulnerabilities, is highly susceptible to the adverse effects of climate change. These effects manifest in the form of increased temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, more frequent and severe droughts, flooding, and extreme weather events. These climate-induced challenges have far-reaching consequences on food security, water resources, health, and livelihoods, disproportionately affecting vulnerable communities.\nAwareness of climate change in Africa has been growing, driven by a combination of scientific research, international agreements like the Paris Agreement, and the work of environmental organizations and activists. Governments, civil society, and grassroots initiatives have been instrumental in raising awareness and advocating for climate action.\nHowever, significant challenges persist. Limited access to information, education, and resources hampers efforts to address climate change effectively. Additionally, the urgency of climate action often competes with other pressing developmental priorities, making it challenging to allocate sufficient resources to mitigate and adapt to climate change. \nIn recent year, African countries have made substantial progress in climate change mitigation and adaptation. Many nations have developed National Adaptation Plans and have taken steps to integrate climate change considerations into their development agendas. \nRenewable energy projects are also on the rise, offering sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels. \nTo further advance climate change awareness and action in Africa, several key strategies should be prioritized: \n\nEducation and Awareness: Strengthening climate change education at all levels of society, from schools to communities, to empower individuals with knowledge and understanding.\nPolicy Integration: Ensuring that climate change considerations are fully integrated into national policies and development plans.\n\nInternational Cooperation: Collaborating with the global community to access funding, technology, and expertise to support climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts.\nCommunity Engagement: Involving local communities in climate action and decision-making processes to ensure sustainable, context-specific solutions.\n\nIn conclusion, climate change awareness in Africa is on the rise, but numerous challenges persist. Concerted efforts are needed to bridge information gaps, integrate climate considerations into policy and development, and ensure equitable access to resources and knowledge. With proactive measures and international collaboration, Africa can harness its potential to mitigate and adapt to climate change, safeguarding its people and ecosystems for generations to come.\n",
