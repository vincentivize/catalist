Delton is a thought-leader in the development of public policies based on Central Bank Digital Currencies, and is a member of the Blockchain Climate Institute. Delton developed the “Global Carbon Reward” policy to help reduce and remove carbon at the speed and scale that are needed to stabilize the climate and meet the 2015 Paris Agreement.
