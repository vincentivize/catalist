The latter class of resources can be freely made available to others without constraint – shared.

"description":"Commoning may be rooted in a variety of social outlooks and behaviors, as we saw in Chapter Four. But can it govern? Can it do so better than existing governments? Can it coordinate more effectively and better than the market? . . .\n\nThe dynamics of peer governance at the cellular level of everyday practices matter because they provide regularity and stability to a commons. They also help us learn how to devise larger structures such as federated commons, commons-friendly law and policy, infrastructures, and commons-public partnerships, as we will see in later chapters. Here, we explore ten dynamics of Peer Governance that tend to be present in effective commons. The first seven revolve around interpersonal and social relationships. The final three involve commons-based methods for dealing with property, money, and markets.\n. . .",

At the outset, people usually have many different reasons and motivations for participating. A commons can emerge only through patient process work that actively recognizes and values the diverse needs, views, talents, and temperaments of all participants. Over time, a commons becomes more robust as people align themselves with each other as individuals while cultivating shared purposes and values.\n\n- The non-hierarchical Unitierra university in Mexico starts by engaging with the experiences and motivations of everyone. It explicitly avoids predefined goals and focuses on people's energy and inclinations 'from everyday life and from the past.'\n\n- A *federated wiki* platform is designed to let people share and collaborate on content-creation while ensuring that different perspectives remain visible.",

Commoning is at heart an act of social self-organization and constant learning whose central purpose is to help people meet needs by producing things or services together. (We prefer to use the word “provisioning” as a nonmarket version of “production.”)\n\nMeeting needs has long been a standard definition of what an economy is all about, so commoning should properly be seen as part of “the economy,” too, even though economics textbooks generally ignore this fact. Commons let people produce food and clothing, shelter and means of transportation, machinery and microscopes, software and hardware, drugs, healthcare, and even prosthetics.3 It is breathtaking how much people can provide for themselves by aligning interests, motivations, and agency toward a common goal. Commoning provides a way to leverage social trust within new organizational forms to coordinate people’s actions.\n\n. . .\n\n",

It has succeeded by ensuring that producers receive what they actually need to live and meet their expenses, not the latest market price. It also avoids commercial intermediaries. As a result, consumers pay a standard price that is significantly below the market price.\n\n- Housing commons associated with the German co-housing federation *Mietshäuser Syndikat* do not charge \"rent\" to its residents based on market rates. Monthly payments correspond to actual building and maintenance expenses. By avoiding market pressures and profit-taking, residency fees are typically lower than conventional rents. However, everyone agrees to pay a solidarity fee to support the launch of new housing projects within the federation.",

"description":"_**How are conflicts addressed?**_\n\nIt is important to have protected spaces in which conflicts can be made visible and their causes understood. An attitude of respect and mutual concern is critical. Complaints focus on concrete behaviors or statements, not individuals. Criticism is balanced with expressions of respect and personal appreciation. An attitude of respect and mutual concern is critical so that relationships can be changed and not destroyed. Anyhow, in some instances separations may be the best option.  \n\n- At the *Cecosesola* cooperative (Venezuela), concrete behaviors are openly and substantially criticized in group settings, but the choice of words and tone remain respectful. After conflict situations, for example, a hug conveys the message: *Whatever our disagreement, I see you as a human being.*\n\n- Systemic coaching, mediations and 'Constellations' workshops can address conflicts while preserving relationships.\n",

"description":"_**How do commoners assure that their structures and rules are appropriate and yet capable of change as needed?**_\n\nIt is important to regularly and collectively reflect on one's own organizational governance. Changing circumstances may require new approaches. Power issues may need to be addressed. Financial risks and institutional dependencies deserve frank debate. Reflecting on a group's patterns of self-organization can help (re)think structures, rules, and processes.\n\n- The network *Fuchsmühle* (Germany) uses this collection of patterns to reflect upon and improve their own self-organization with a variety of somatic and deliberative methods.\n\n- Supervision and coaching can help visualize and adapt governance structures.\n\n- Governance issues should be regularly revisited in calm, quiet moments so that people have opportunities to raise difficult, big questions.\n",

"description":"_**How can we communicate effectively?**_\n\nSelf-responsible communication means honestly and respectfully expressing one's own needs and limits. This requires appropriate times and circumstances as well as a sense of one's own demeanor and tone in communication. In direct exchanges, active listening and compassionate speaking are important. With individual and collective self-awareness, norms of communication can be regularly reviewed and improved.\n\n- Communication rules are agreed upon in both digital and analog spaces. Suitable moderation methods – such as 'talking stick' rounds – allow all participants to speak without time pressure or tyranny of the loudest ones.\n\n- [**Nonviolent communication**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication) supports the implementation of this pattern.\n\n- A good motto is: _Speak spontaneously and from the heart. and listen from the heart._\n\n**new pattern from Patterning cards ~ Novemver 2024**\n",

"description":"The British sociologist Raymond Williams once wrote, “Culture is ordinary.” We could say much the same about commoning. It is terribly ordinary. Commoning is what common people decide for themselves in their specific circumstances if they want to get along with each other and produce as much wealth for everyone as possible. If commoning can be considered a way of life or a type of culture, then it provides what any culture must — “meaning both in a formal and in a deeply existential sense,” as art sociologist Pascal Gielen writes.1 Modern societies have largely forgotten about commoning. Therefore, showcasing its elemental dailyness opens the door for seeing how the commons can provide a platform for effective alternatives to capitalism.\n\nWe start our explorations with the Social Life of commoning because its motifs constitute the core of any commons while also manifesting in the two other spheres, Provisioning and Peer Governance.\n. . .\nIn modern times, market capitalism and its categories of thought have more or less mandated how we will behave, invest, organize institutions, and so forth, by presuming that human beings are basically selfish, materialistic, utility-maximizing individuals. No wonder commoning, with its different insights about human beings, is so often seen as strange. It has been eclipsed by the shiny cultural mindscape of modernity.\n\nAnd yet, the way commoning catalyzes change is clear: the more you align yourself with a commons worldview and the more you practice commoning, the more you learn how to become a commoner. This, in turn, has sweeping ramifications for economics, politics, and culture. The patterns that comprise the Social Life of Commoning are specific forms of cooperation, sharing, and ways that people relate to each other. One could say that a commons arises when the patterns of Social Life reach a sufficient density of practice, threshold of self-organization, and continuity to express themselves as a coherent social institution.",
