The latter class of resources can be freely made available to others without constraint – shared. The commons way is not only to share but also to contribute freely, meaning that contributions are made unconditionally, with no assurance of getting something of equivalent worth back immediately.\n\n- The *OpenSpim *open source community produces specialized scientific microscope designs. *Open Bionics* develops shareable prostheses.\n\n- Licenses for *OpenSourceSeeds* help assure that seeds for crops will not be patented or privatized, thus encouraging everyone to share their seed innovations.  \n\n- The *Drugs for Neglected Diseases* Initiative researches and develops affordable medications for serious diseases that conventional pharmaceutical companies have dismissed as unprofitable.",

At the outset, people usually have many different reasons and motivations for participating. A commons can emerge only through patient process work that actively recognizes and values the diverse needs, views, talents, and temperaments of all participants. Over time, a commons becomes more robust as people align themselves with each other as individuals while cultivating shared purposes and values.\n\n- The non-hierarchical Unitierra university in Mexico starts by engaging with the experiences and motivations of everyone. It explicitly avoids predefined goals and focuses on people's energy and inclinations 'from everyday life and from the past.'\n\n- A *federated wiki* platform is designed to let people share and collaborate on content-creation while ensuring that different perspectives remain visible.",

A commons is stronger and more resilient when relevant information can be openly shared, even if it takes courage.\n\nIn order to strengthen group trust, it's not only important to have appropriate structures and procedures for disclosure, but also emotional space for sharing. \n\n- Procedures for routinely sharing documentation with everyone is important.

"description":"_**How are nested organizational structures built? Do they prevent abuse of power?**_\n\nAbove a certain level of complexity, heterarchies are indispensable for a system to function.

Still, at times, rules are violated, which can result in disagreements and conflicts. In these cases, sanctions may be required.  But the first priority is to surface the reasons for a rules-violation and to reflect on that reality.

"description":"_**How to allocate things that are depleted through use in complex, large-scale circumstances?**_\n\nLimited, depletable resources cannot be made available without limitation, and in any case, sometimes it's not essential to give everyone a strictly equal share. After pooling what is available and setting a cap on overall use, a commons can make a solidarity-based apportionment: a roughly equivalent allocation of benefits (\"mutualization\") based on a prior agreement. Everyone who can, should contribute. Entitlements are not strictly linked to the contributions made, however.\n\n- In state social security systems, contributions are based on income, but benefits are not. Needs take priority over original contributions. This lies at the heart of mutualization.\n\n- Community-based health insurance funds such as *Artabana* and *Solidago* in the German-speaking countries operate with a similar ethic of mutualization.",

They can strive to make the full production costs transparent and then try to meet the needs of all parties involved without regard to market price or norms.\n\n- The cooperative association *Cecosesola* (Venezuela) has been operating large, crisis-resilient food markets for decades. It has succeeded by ensuring that producers receive what they actually need to live and meet their expenses, not the latest market price. It also avoids commercial intermediaries. As a result, consumers pay a standard price that is significantly below the market price.\n\n- Housing commons associated with the German co-housing federation *Mietshäuser Syndikat* do not charge \"rent\" to its residents based on market rates. Monthly payments correspond to actual building and maintenance expenses. By avoiding market pressures and profit-taking, residency fees are typically lower than conventional rents. However, everyone agrees to pay a solidarity fee to support the launch of new housing projects within the federation.",

"description":"_**How do commoners assure that their structures and rules are appropriate and yet capable of change as needed?**_\n\nIt is important to regularly and collectively reflect on one's own organizational governance. Changing circumstances may require new approaches. Power issues may need to be addressed. Financial risks and institutional dependencies deserve frank debate. Reflecting on a group's patterns of self-organization can help (re)think structures, rules, and processes.\n\n- The network *Fuchsmühle* (Germany) uses this collection of patterns to reflect upon and improve their own self-organization with a variety of somatic and deliberative methods.\n\n- Supervision and coaching can help visualize and adapt governance structures.\n\n- Governance issues should be regularly revisited in calm, quiet moments so that people have opportunities to raise difficult, big questions.\n",

"description":"_**How can we communicate effectively?**_\n\nSelf-responsible communication means honestly and respectfully expressing one's own needs and limits. This requires appropriate times and circumstances as well as a sense of one's own demeanor and tone in communication. In direct exchanges, active listening and compassionate speaking are important. With individual and collective self-awareness, norms of communication can be regularly reviewed and improved.\n\n- Communication rules are agreed upon in both digital and analog spaces. Suitable moderation methods – such as 'talking stick' rounds – allow all participants to speak without time pressure or tyranny of the loudest ones.\n\n- [**Nonviolent communication**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication) supports the implementation of this pattern.\n\n- A good motto is: _Speak spontaneously and from the heart. and listen from the heart._\n\n**new pattern from Patterning cards ~ Novemver 2024**\n",
