"summary":"Florida Sea Grant is a federal-state partnership supporting research, Extension and education for the sustainable use of ocean and coastal resources. UF is our host institution but we work statewide through supporting research at numerous institutions. State-funded positions can serve as match. Galen and I discussed a number of projects ranging from supporting the development of high-tech energy saving (low carbon) off and onshore aquaculture operation for domestic seafood production, science-based marine contractor trainings for plastic-free  living shorelines, and even experience with 'legal clinics' that draft local ordinances for small or underserved communities including zoning and permitting issues. Research also has led to changing building codes to improve resiliency based on studies conducted at FIU's Wall of Wind (which is getting a water facility to jointly examine new structures ability to address wind and water inundation).",

"summary":"Leneita grew up in the woods of New England, where there was far more exposure to pine trees than the sea.  However, most summers she would travel to Maine, often for months,  to spend time along the coast. This curiosity with the ocean began in childhood and followed her into adulthood.  For over two decades, this love of the sea was used to help students in under resourced neighborhoods discover new avenues of education and exploration. In 2018, Leneita started with The Reef Institute as the Director of Education. \n\nIn 2019, Leneita was asked to step into the Executive Director position, drawing from over 23 years in the non-profit world working in strategic planning, direction and growth.  It was with great joy that Leneita took the helm of this organization. Leneita loves knowing that not only do we educate others, but we are apart of the solution to save our ocean. ",

"summary":"For more than 45 years, the Museum of Discovery and Science (MODS) in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, has been the primary informal education resource for STEM – science, technology, engineering, math – in Broward County, a region home to 1.9 million residents and 13 million annual tourists.  Conveniently located in Broward County, the Museum serves all of South Florida.   As a non-profit organization, whose mission is connecting people to inspiring science, we provide educational and cultural experiences for 450,000+ visitors and program participants annually; in the past year visitors came to our 150,000 sq. ft. facility from all 50 U.S. states and 27 foreign countries. MODS has been accredited by the American Alliance of Museums for three decades (only 3% of science museums are accredited for excellence and distinction in the field). Reaccreditation was awarded in February 2023.  In the past two years, we have added to that distinction by being named the Hub for Resilience Education, selected by the LEGO Foundation as one of only 15 museums nationwide to participate in their Playful Learning Museum Network; and awarded the 2023 IMLS National Medal for Museum Service at a White House ceremony in July 2023.\n\nThe MODS experience is extensive and evolves to meet the needs of our region. Our flagship programs include: (1) MODS STEMobile, a fleet of five mobile makerspaces launched during the pandemic, delivering programs to 60,000+ youth annually, with 76% of programs delivered free to at-risk children in low-income communities; (2) Our new Discovery Spot exhibit hall and Sprouting STEM Early Childhood Learning Lab, providing STREAM activities (STEM plus Reading and Art) for ages 0-6; (3) Youth Climate Summit, inspiring Broward County Public School students (from the 6th largest school district in the nation) to share their voice regarding environmental issues; (4) Visit Lauderdale Science Festival, a new resilience showcase highlighting the work of regional corporations, universities, scientists and researchers; (5) Paid Workforce Development Internships for 105 high school students in our Everglades EcoExplorers and Aviation Academy; and (6) Inclusivity Programs that extend the Museum’s accessibility, including a Kids Club with free admission for non-profit agencies, Museums for All offering $2 admission for low-income families receiving EBT/SNAP benefits; and Sensory-Sundays with free admission and special programs for children and adults with autism. The Museum’s $11.6 million budget is achieved through earned income (62%), philanthropy (31%) and government support (7%).\n\nMODS: The Hub for Resilience Education\nIn 2019, MODS developed its 2020-2025 Strategic Plan, a year-long process informed by surveys, interviews and 28 roundtable discussions among Board, leadership, senior staff, volunteers, Museum members, visitors, educators, donors and community stakeholders. Four educational content pillars are identified in the Strategic Plan, – Environmental Sustainability, Early Childhood Education, Health & Wellness and Physical Science – pillars that define the focus of the Museum’s exhibitions, programs and partnerships. \n\nEnvironmental Sustainability has become the foremost educational content pillar, resulting in the Museum being designated as the Hub for Resilience Education by the Board of the Community Foundation of Broward. As the Hub, MODS has assumed the role of anchor and champion of the community’s conversation, education and action regarding environmental sustainability and resilience. Our goal: to engage children and adults through a creative atmosphere that inspires innovative thinking and empowers them to make themselves, their families and their communities resilient to the impact of climate change.\n",

This collaborative network unites stakeholders who are keen to integrate and stack their solutions for greater impact. LBEF focuses on regenerating oceans and water resources, adopting a comprehensive capital approach that includes both non-profit (concessionary grant capital) and for-profit (venture equity capital) investments. By bringing together diverse members of the blue economy, LBEF facilitates a more cohesive and effective strategy for unlocking blue finance and business development. This approach not only catalyzes the blue economy and its stakeholders, including startups through \"blue bonds\" and water and marine ecosystem credits, but also promotes the evolution of non-profits into self-sustainable, benefit corporations (B-corps). LBEF thus plays a crucial role in attracting donations and growth-stage capital investments, freeing up philanthropic funds to innovate and develop next-generation solutions.",

I have over 30 years of experience in opening markets and distribution networks for a fortune 100 company in the medical device, renewable energy, geothermal, solar, and other industries. I have also traveled the world to learn about different cultures and customer needs, and to establish long-term partnerships and relationships. I am skilled in negotiations, sales and marketing, quality and manufacturing, and business development. My goal is to create products that solve real-world problems and make a positive impact on the environment and society.\n\nNikao is a company that I founded in 2000 to develop innovative medical devices that enhance the quality of life for people around the world. One of our breakthrough products is the Neural-Enabled Prosthesis (NEP) system, which simulates the sense of touch and feel for users of prosthetic hands. We developed this system in collaboration with Florida International University, and it has received positive feedback from the medical community and the users. Over the last 24 years, we have designed, developed and manufactured blood cancer analyzers, skin cancer analyzers, and many other amazing technologies. \n\nWe recently developed the world's first AI-Enabled Geothermal Technology that not only saves up to 70% of energy costs, but will also allow you to set the absolute humidity in your home, office, or commercial space. Being able to control the humidity provides many health and physical benefits. The Purification System included in our Geo Systems neutralizes all mold, fungus, germs and viruses including Covid-19. You can actually run our entire 6 Ton Geo system with as little as 5-6 solar panels. Also, for the first time ever you do not need to dig expensive and destructive vertical or horizontal loops to be able to enjoy the amazing benefits of geothermal. And, most importantly, we patented our Thermal Storage Tank that eliminates the necessity to drill vertical or horizontal loops allowing everyone to finally have access to the amazing benefits of Geothermal. Our systems also has an amazing benefit of providing up to 24 gallons of fresh potable water per day.",

"summary":"Reef Arches (multiple Patent Pending) addresses the call of flooding due to sea level rise (SLR) by reducing wave energy and allowing existing infrastructure to be more effective. It also aids in shoreline preservation and restoration by serving as essential infrastructure to facilitate a robust living shoreline. Contrary to traditional wave break methods, the more natural \"flow-through design\" reduces destructive channelization of water that rip-rap and other methods often promote. \n\nBecause wave energy dictates the weight requirements, Reef Arches offers a full-range of appropriate sizes for the site (50 pounds, 1200 pounds, 7200 pounds).\n\nOur optional Low Impact Deployment System (patent pending) is essential to many inaccessible or environmentally sensitive locations. This patent pending system utilizes no heavy machinery. \n\nApplications: wave breaks, coral restoration, oyster reefs, seawall preservation, barrier reef extensions, seagrass restoration, ecotourism. \n\nUnique Specifications: \n* open \"flow through design\" allows in light for the growth of mangroves, seagrass, and coral\n* very high surface area to weight ratio (approx 12:1)\n* this very efficient design allows for the use of high-grade materials such as CSA concrete\n* the effectiveness of CSA concrete is highly effective at recruiting sessile marine organisms such as oysters, coral, etc. ",
