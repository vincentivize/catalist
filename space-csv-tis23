The majority of nonprofits lack operating reserves and access to savings or investments, leading to a loss of trust and fewer donations. Blockchain can address these issues by channeling more funding to local impactful organizations and allowing nonprofits worldwide to fundraise from a global audience. By investing in tokenized assets, nonprofits can provide for themselves in perpetuity, while donors can see the impact of their dollars grow. By democratizing access to financial opportunity, blockchain technology can lead to a more just and equitable world where local organizations on the ground get the sustainable funding they need to drive impactful solutions.,Chauncey St. John

The only options available to them are so costly that they result in high rates of defaults and/or perpetual debt entrapment. This cyclical spiral results in a chronic lack of liquidity and underemployment, which severely constrain economic growth and human development in many regions around the world.  The estimated unmet demand for credit in these markets is 5.2T, which traditional finance has proven inadequate to address. Innovative financial models within the collaborative finance umbrella are better suited for tackling this problem because they don’t rely solely on external capital sources to bootstrap funding, and thus lower the cost of credit. I will share about our team’s contribution to collaborative finance, the stable credit protocol, which provides communities the tools they need to build a more self-reliant credit system and improve their local economy, while simultaneously gaining access to the global financial network. \n,Sayer Tindall

In a world marked by rapid change, education must extend beyond traditional boundaries, and I will explore practical strategies to foster a culture of continuous learning. Drawing from Deloitte Insights' observations on corporate learning shifts and personal anecdotes, I'll emphasize the importance of integrating learning into daily life, workplaces, and even service projects. Ultimately, my talk will highlight how giving permission to learn empowers individuals, enhances career trajectories, and contributes to impactful education in an ever-evolving world.,Erin Huizenga

We harness the power of the sun and the power of the blockchain to deliver real-world impact by providing reliable and affordable access to clean electricity while reducing CO2e and increasing climate resilience.\n\nWe believe decentralized, clean energy is a public good, and we’ve witnessed how small solar solutions unlock tangible benefits including community agency, self-sufficiency and climate resilience. We work to ensure that no one is left behind in the transition to renewables, especially climate-vulnerable people in rural sub-Saharan Africa—people experiencing increasingly severe climate effects while contributing the least to the climate crisis.\n\nThe Solar Foundation has completed off-grid solar projects in Uganda, Nigeria and Puerto Rico (please see the Solar Foundation website for details and pictures). We are currently working on a microgrid project for a school in Tanzania, planning a novel community solar + UBI pilot project with GoodDollar and an impact certs project with Switch to monitor our solar data for retroactive funding\n,Coleen Chase

This abstract provides an overview of the current state of climate change awareness in Africa, highlighting the challenges faced, the progress achieved, and the critical steps needed to address this pressuring issue.\nAfrica, with its diverse climates and vulnerabilities, is highly susceptible to the adverse effects of climate change. These effects manifest in the form of increased temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, more frequent and severe droughts, flooding, and extreme weather events. These climate-induced challenges have far-reaching consequences on food security, water resources, health, and livelihoods, disproportionately affecting vulnerable communities.\nAwareness of climate change in Africa has been growing, driven by a combination of scientific research, international agreements like the Paris Agreement, and the work of environmental organizations and activists. Governments, civil society, and grassroots initiatives have been instrumental in raising awareness and advocating for climate action.\nHowever, significant challenges persist. Limited access to information, education, and resources hampers efforts to address climate change effectively. Additionally, the urgency of climate action often competes with other pressing developmental priorities, making it challenging to allocate sufficient resources to mitigate and adapt to climate change. \nIn recent year, African countries have made substantial progress in climate change mitigation and adaptation. Many nations have developed National Adaptation Plans and have taken steps to integrate climate change considerations into their development agendas. \nRenewable energy projects are also on the rise, offering sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels. \nTo further advance climate change awareness and action in Africa, several key strategies should be prioritized: \n\nEducation and Awareness: Strengthening climate change education at all levels of society, from schools to communities, to empower individuals with knowledge and understanding.\nPolicy Integration: Ensuring that climate change considerations are fully integrated into national policies and development plans.\n\nInternational Cooperation: Collaborating with the global community to access funding, technology, and expertise to support climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts.\nCommunity Engagement: Involving local communities in climate action and decision-making processes to ensure sustainable, context-specific solutions.\n\nIn conclusion, climate change awareness in Africa is on the rise, but numerous challenges persist. Concerted efforts are needed to bridge information gaps, integrate climate considerations into policy and development, and ensure equitable access to resources and knowledge. With proactive measures and international collaboration, Africa can harness its potential to mitigate and adapt to climate change, safeguarding its people and ecosystems for generations to come.\n,Timothy Kwabla Zilevu

There is ample evidence to indicate that regenerating the local small Water Cycle significantly provides beneficial influence to the greater planetary Water Cycle. \n\nThe traditional Native Hawaiian model of the Moku Ahupua'a Watershed management system and the rainforest guardianship of the Amazon biosphere by the Indigenous Peoples is clear proof of concept that what is being proposed, adapted to each Watersheds' unique circumstances and to our modern times, is a simple system that will work well over the long run. The torching of Lahaina is a prime example of the dire consequences in following land use practices that DO NOT work, killing our precious children.\n\nWe already have every tool we will need, as well as a full quiver of expertise and viable solutions ready to engage for this movement. What we're missing is the comprehensive organizational design framework serving to bridge our vast inspiration for a world that works for All Life with the effective, efficient implementation of practical field projects getting the work done in the shortest amount of time.\n\nOn behalf of generations far into the future. we must ask ourselves, how do we organize our species in turning the tipping point towards abundant thriving life?\n\nTHIS is the most important conversation we could be having as we gather together during this Climate Week in NYC.,Elizabeth Herald

The only options available to them are so costly that they result in high rates of defaults and/or perpetual debt entrapment. This cyclical spiral results in a chronic lack of liquidity and underemployment, which severely constrain economic growth and human development in many regions around the world.  The estimated unmet demand for credit in these markets is 5.2T, which traditional finance has proven inadequate to address. Innovative financial models within the collaborative finance umbrella are better suited for tackling this problem because they don’t rely solely on external capital sources to bootstrap funding, and thus lower the cost of credit. I will share about our team’s contribution to collaborative finance, the stable credit protocol, which provides communities the tools they need to build a more self-reliant credit system and improve their local economy, while simultaneously gaining access to the global financial network.,Sayer Tindall
