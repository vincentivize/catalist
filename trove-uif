"description":"Courtlandt Butts is a lifetime educator and advocate for equity and social change. He has\\nconsulted, trained and educated c-suite executives, school systems, faith-based organizations\\nand municipal entities domestically and internationally. Since 2007, Mr. Butts has led Justice,\\nEquity, Diversity & Inclusion (JEDI) efforts for Courageous Conversation, a consulting firm\\ncommitted to achieving racial equity located in San Francisco, CA.\\nInitially Mr. Butts partnered primarily with K-12 systems, but for the past several years, he has\\nspecialized in other sectors whose aim is to achieve racial equity including, county and city\\ngovernments, philanthropic foundations, health care systems and law enforcement. He\\nsupported the transformational work with entities such as Boulder County, Austin Police\\nDepartment, DISCO, Cherry Creek Schools, Australian Federal Police and the Joliet Area\\nCommunity Hospice Center. Having studied various religions and forms of spiritual\\ndevelopment, Mr. Butts has partnered with faith-based organizations such as Holy Trinity\\nLutheran Church in MN and the Unitarian Universalist Church in FL to contextualize their\\nrespective doctrines as they engage in efforts of advocating for reparations and racial healing.\\nCourtlandt is a proud graduate of Florida A&M University (FAMU) an HBCU where he received\\na B.S. in Elementary Education and the University of Northern Iowa (UNI) where he completed\\nhis M.S. in department of Curriculum and Instruction. Following a staff position at UNI he\\ncontinued his calling as an educator securing a tenure track position in the Education\\nDepartment at Spelman College in Atlanta, GA., where early childhood and secondary\\nprograms emphasized urban education, advocacy and culturally responsive pedagogy. He\\nserves his local community by providing aquatic services as a faculty level trainer for the\\nYMCA and American Red Cross, as well as SCUBA diving instruction for underrepresented\\npopulations, including diver candidates with special needs. This work fuels his interests in\\nenvironmental justice as he prepares the youth to become citizen scientists and stewards of\\nthe ocean. Recently, Courtlandt followed a path of his own creation, giving way to the forming\\nof LifeGuardian Worldwide, LLC.\\n\\nIntentionally, LifeGuardian Worldwide takes a deeper dive into the core of our humanity by\\nabiding by the spiritual basis of this work. It threads this aspect with a series of JEDI-focused\\nworks – executive coaching, trainer training, strategic planning for organizational\\ntransformation, among them, all augmented by the use of biomimicry to heal and restore\\nsocial systems just as nature’s systems are able to heal and restore themselves.",

Omri has been nationally recognized for his work with Design FC, and has led collaborations with the Kevin Durant Family Foundation, Major League Soccer, EA Sports FIFA, and several professional sports teams. \\n\\nOmri founded Design FC as a Eugene Lang Opportunity Scholar at Swarthmore College, where he studied Peace & Conflict Studies and Psychology. His deep interest in social entrepreneurship led him to become a UIF fellow and ultimately help launch Swarthmore’s Social Innovation Lab. After graduating in 2020, Omri became a lecturer and facilitator at the Stanford d.school, where he challenged students to use design as a tool to visually express issues pertaining to their lived experiences and identities.
