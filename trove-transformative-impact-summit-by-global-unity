Delton did his doctoral research on the hydrology of a coral cay in the Great Barrier Reef, and he has 20 years of combined experience in groundwater management, environmental impact assessment, geothermal energy and climate mitigation. Delton is a thought-leader in the development of public policies based on Central Bank Digital Currencies, and is a member of the Blockchain Climate Institute. Delton developed the “Global Carbon Reward” policy to help reduce and remove carbon at the speed and scale that are needed to stabilize the climate and meet the 2015 Paris Agreement. Delton believes that the Global Carbon Reward can fill the funding gap for climate mitigation and help protect communities and ecosystems from the ravages of climate change and over-consumption.",
